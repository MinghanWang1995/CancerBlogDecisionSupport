In addition academic paper on cancer, blog is a popular tool for people to voice their personal experience, thoughts or even professional regarding different types and stages of cancer. The goal of this project is to analyze the cancer blogs and show the result in an applicable format. This is a text-based analytics and require python coding to realize the functions. The task is to generate the closest blog outcome from the dataset once new text is give. To accomplish this task, my team decided to use machine learning in text analytics field to calculate the most similar text. 

II.	Data Description 
The dataset text file from 1594 blogs. The blogs contains different length and focus on cancer. The 1594 text files and each document is treated as one object, combined in a single text file to be processed. Text preparation process such as tokenization, stop words removal and stemming will be explained in the following section. 




III.	Methodology
1.	Data preprocessing
●	Tokenization
●	Stopwords Removal
●	Stemming
2.	Model Building
●	Build Doc2Vec Model
●	Train the model
●	Get output
3.	GUI Building 
●	Using Tkinter library, build the user interface
