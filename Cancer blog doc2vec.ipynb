Some positive news on the liver cancer front was discovered recently, as cancer specialists said that the drug sorafenib was seen to give liver cancer patients long lifespans compared to study participants who took dummy pills at the same time. The survival rates were 10.7 months and 8 months, respectively.What does this say? Well, there is more hope for liver cancer sufferers than before, although this study did not have what many would consider to be earth-shattering results. The big news here is that this is the first time something (anything) has been seen to give liver cancer patients any kind of survival advantage. That, in itself, is very good news.  Comments: 1.

       " \"With Arizona having the lowest adult sunburn total and Utah the highest, why are American adults seeing more sunburns these days? Are people spending more time outdoors or are sunscreens and other preventative measures not being used like they have been in the past? Heather chimed in on a recent post of mine today, but in the sense of giving my two cents on preventative measures, here are a few.While a decent, natural sunscreen with an SPF factor of at least 15 is always a great idea for those who spend quite a bit of time in the sun, even a single sunburn can increase the risk that an adult or child will develop skin cancer. In other words, regularly seek shade, cover up and use preventative measures this summer if spending any amount of time exposed to the sun.Umbrellas on the beach, patio covers or portable awnings in the backyard and shade trees while out hiking are all great ways to prevent that sunburn while outside getting fresh air and regular exercise. There is so much to do in the summer outdoors but just as many ways to ensure you don't get overexposed to the sun. My personal favorite that is a great conversation starter? How about the personal head umbrella? Looks like fun to me, and it will keep the sun off those faces, shoulders, noses and necks in most cases. That right there is a very decent dose of prevention if you ask me. Comments: \",\n",

       " 'A study released this week concluded that the type of prostate cancer treatment a patient receives is heavily influenced by the kind of specialist he sees initially.With several methods of prostate cancer treatment being available, it seems a bit inconsistent that a certain type of specialist can influence the type of treatment a prostate cancer patient ends up receiving. Shouldn\\'t all possible variables unique to each patient determine that?I agree with this statement by Dr. Thomas Jang: \"You want your physician to convey this information without a bias.\" I agree here -- regardless of if the doctor is an oncologist or a urologist, the best type of treatment for each individual case should always be the goal, right? Comments: 1. A trusting partnership between doctor and patient that facilitates informed consent is a goal for many proactive patients. Such a partnership requires an understanding of all the factors that lead to a treatment recommendation. In light of the precious little in the way of guidance from clinical trials with respect to best empiric treatment, which is based on medical journal articles, epidemiology and economics, physician\\'s decisions need to be based on personal experience, clinical insights, and medical training.2. Discovering I had prostate cancer at the age of 47 was almost an accident and certainly not something that in any way I expected. I had no symptoms - none whatsoever. In layman\\'s terms, everything seemed to work fine. So the discovery of prostate cancer was quite accidental. It seems I had gone to my doctor simply requesting a pill (propecia - a drug to reduce hair loss). She required I have a blood test, as this drug would have an effect on my PSA. Frankly, all that was greek to me...as I didn\\'t know what PSA was and had never had it checked. I hated needles - had always said I was allergic to them - hence I avoided being stuck as much as I could. But on this day in November 2004 I decided to take the plunge - have my blood checked - and get the prescription.Two days later I got a call while out of town saying that all the lab work was fine except that my PSA was a bit elevated - it was 4.58 and for someone my age that was high. My doctor referred me to a Urologist. The appointment was set.Of course I had some concern, but after all, all the plumbing seem to work fine and I had no symptoms, so surely there was no problem. The Urologist\\'s exam was routine - in fact he said he thought I had nothing to worry about as he felt nothing abnormal. But, to be on the safe side he schedule a biopsy. Being fearful of needles (and a biopsy is the ultimate needle) I asked if it would hurt. His response, \"Most men don\\'t really feel a thing.\" That was a lie! Looking back, I would have asked for good drugs as that was the most painful experience I can recall.Several days following the biopsy I received the results. Prostate Cancer! I had a Gleason score of 6 and 30% of one side of my prostate was cancerous. My heart sank as I received the news. How could I, a 47 year old healthy male, with no other medical issues have prostate cancer? And, how amazing that it was caught by a simple test that my well versed female doctor required. Looking back, her diligence saved my life.What next?My local doctor wanted to schedule surgery immediately. He said I had four options: (1) Radical prostotectemy (traditional surgery); (2) Radiation; (3) Hormone therapy and/or (4) Watch and wait. Again, he recommended surgery. My immediate question was how many of the surgeries that he was suggesting did he do weekly or monthly. The number was low. In the back of my mind I thought, \"Hum, maybe I need someone who isn\\'t so surgery happy and who does this delicate removal frequently.\" I was like learning to play golf - I would prefer to learn from someone who plays daily than learn from a weekend hacker. Maybe that analogy seems harsh, but after all the decision made would have lasting and profound effects.Following the meeting with the Urologist, and after telling my family (who thought I was joking), I spent some time in research. First thing I found - based on my diagnosis - I had time to consider carefully my options. Not that nothing should be done, but I didn\\'t have to rush into any hasty decisions. Prostate cancer generally is slow in it\\'s progression. CAUTION - do not use my experience as a crutch to avoid treatment (I witnessed my father-in-law die from complications from prostate cancer), rather, seek competent medical help in making your treatment decisions.Options Considered:Watch and wait. Well for several months I did just that. I researched - changed my diet - considered the possibility that I could reverse what existed and even reduce the cancer. I began a regiment of daily intake of cottage cheese and flax seed oil. For a short time I actually saw a decrease in my PSA; however, that was short lived. What I did learn was that diet was important - not only for general well being - but an effective tool in promoting a cancer free body. This was valuable time in that it gave me the opportunity to consider all my options.Radiation Therapy. Not really an option for me. While I talked with a man in his late 60\\'s to early 70\\'s who had outstanding results using focused radiation (proton therapy I think it was called), the reality is - once you opt for radiation and the tissue is destroyed, if prostate cancer returns, it cannot be surgically removed. Hence the best advice I received was, in my case, this would not be a practical option. By the way information on proton treatment can be found at <A href=\"http://www.protons.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.protons.com/</A> or at <A href=\"http://www.llu.edu/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.llu.edu/</A>. The people I talked with who had used this treatment were extremely pleased with the level of care they received and the overall outcome.High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU). In my search for the right treatment, I spent much time in considering this alternative. There were three practical objectives I wished to accomplish with whatever treatment I selected: (1) Cancer elimination, (2) Minimal issues with incontinence (preferably none) and (3) minimal issues with erectile function (again, preferably none). Based on my Gleason score and prostate cancer diagnosis, it seemed that this treatment would be viable. For research information visit <A href=\"http://www.ushifu.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.ushifu.com/</A>. As part of my consideration I met with Dr. George Suarez, Medical Director for USHifu. He reviewed my medical background and was kind in taking the time to discuss with me my options using this new prostate cancer treatment. Dr. Suarez took the time to explain all my options and how, if I elected, HIFU could be effective while meeting my three objectives. My only resistance was, at the time, it was not an option yet approved by the FDA in the United States, hence I would have to seek the treatment outside the scope of my medical insurance outside of the country. While I gave this serious consideration, I ultimately decided to go another route.Radical Prostatectomy. All of the possibilities above, brought me back to the original suggestion - SURGERY. The issue I had was what kind and who would perform it. Since I had the time to research I discovered (through the wonder of the Internet) this, then, new procedure called a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. Hum...seemed that needed more study. Of course, at the time, Johns Hopkins Brady Urological Institute was recognized as one of the best in the world for prostate cancer research and study. After careful consideration I contacted Johns Hopkins inquiring about this seemingly new procedure - using the daVinci Surgical System. www.urology.jhu.edu/MIS/daVinci/The folks at Johns Hopkins could not have been more caring and helpful as I sought all my treatment options. Of course, they reviewed my file carefully and spent all the time I wanted and needed to evaluate my options. Dr. Li-Ming Su was my surgeon and my hat is off to him and his skill and patience. In the end, one thing was clear - all other options being equal - surgical removal was still the \"gold standard\" in the fight against prostate cancer. Likewise, it appeared that this robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy would meet my three objectives.The surgery went fine - of course I don\\'t remember a thing - so all I can base it on what the Doctor\\'s report. Initially the report indicated that the cancer was contained in the prostate and the removal should yield me \"cancer free.\" Of course this was to be confirmed later from lab reports. The first several days following surgery were not pleasant, but tolerable. Within three days, I boarded a plane and flew home to North Carolina - travel was not a big issue. The most discomforting thing following surgery was the catheter - which remained in for three weeks.Outcome. Within four weeks following surgery I boarded a plane to Dallas, TX to begin a new job. My energy level was back and I had minimal incontinence isses with subsided within another three weeks. Within seven weeks of surgery incontinence was not an issue. Erecticle function returned within three months (with the aid of medication) and returned to full function (without medication) within twelve months.Now it\\'s been two years since surgery and all three objective have been achieved. Life is normal. I am cancer free. My sincere thanks to all who were there for me as I sought out the treatment that was right for me. I would not have the opportunity to function as a motivational speaker today if it were not for the skill and help of the fine folks at Johns Hopkins. While printing such personal items for all to read may seem (to some) out there! I feel that, perhaps, others who find themselves diagnosed with prostate cancer may learn from my experience.

Adrenal cancer, although one of the rarest forms of cancer, is being shone in a brighter light, though, as a new drug may be able to buy time for those stricken with it.A new study out of Europe concluded that Mitotane (a drug for adrenocortical cancer) can give patients months of additional life without severe side effects. Although adrenocortical cancer is rare, the standard treatment involves surgery -- but with many patients seeing multiple relapses. With Mitotane being used in large doses during those relapses (to try and stop them), the most significant side effect is exhaustive fatigue -- to the point of some patients losing all quality of life.

I\\'ve always been of the mind that high levels of isolated nutrients may not be good for the human body at all (or be completely ineffective), and the attention to not using vitamin D supplements in the wake of this news confirm this line of thinking.In general, the working together of several vitamins and minerals at the same time in the body generally gives the best and more preventative results.

For those adverse to taking supplements, this is a great reminder. It has been estimated that 24,000 people die in the U.S. each year due to lack of sun exposure (presumably secondary to lack of vitamin D). This is more than twice the number that die from skin cancer. Despite the sunscreen industries apparent recommendation that we should avoid the sun and never venture out without sunscreen, taking a ten to fifteen minute walk in the sun, without sunscreen, preferably before 11 AM or after 4 PM can result in the absorption of the vitamin D levels suggested in recent studies on vitamin D and cancer prevention.I do understand that this is not always possible in northern climates, or in individuals who are unable to get outside or have other conditions that contribute to low vitamin D levels. In those situations it is important for individuals to discuss with their physician the option of a supplement.Lynne Eldridge M.D.Author, \"Avoiding Cancer One Day At A Time\"<A href=\"http://www.avoidcancernow.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.avoidcancernow.com/</A>3.

I like these discussions, and I use them as fuel to speak about the benefits of a good diet to those who may be undergoing (or about to undergo) chemotherapy.One of the more exotic diet choices for those just starting to study cancer diets is the \"macrobiotic\" diet. This diet includes items like organic whole grains, fruits and vegetables, soups made with vegetables, seaweed, grains, beans, and miso. Occasional servings of fresh whitefish, nuts, seeds and pickles. Some cancer specialists and naturopaths even suggest that this diet can exist with traditional cancer treatment or be a separate alternative treatment.The foods above sound like a great diet for anyone alive if you ask me, but I can especially see the cancer patient benefiting from these dietary suggestions.

       " 'Can ovarian cancer be identified by certain symptoms? That is the finding of cancer experts this week who announced that possibly insignificant events and signs can turn out to be real-life indicators of ovarian cancer. And, the identification of these relatively light (benign) signs can, however, save lives according the report.Signs such as bloating, abdominal pain and even eating difficulties are among the signs that one may have ovarian cancer. Although these signs are not really significant in many circles, they can all be significant indicators when recognized as such. In fact, all these signs -- if they persist daily for a few weeks -- should be investigated by your doctor or oncologist. Comments: 1. There is no consistently reliable, accurate screening test to detect ovarian cancer. For women known to be at a high risk for ovarian cancer, doctors use the blood test CA-125, as well as a pelvic exam and transvaginal ultrasound, to detect cancer. But the CA-125 test, though somewhat good at detecting recurrences of cancer, is not good enough by itself to screen the general population. Be mindful of blood clots (particularly if on estrogen replacement therapy). Certain cancers like ovarian can increase levels of substances that help blood clot.One of the most promising new approaches that may deal with early detection of cancer is called Proteomics (Protein Expression Analysis), the study of proteins in the cells, tissues and body fluids. Even before a tumor can be felt, some researchers have found, the tumor begins secreting a distinctive pattern, or fingerprint of proteins. Here, you go beyond genes (DNA, the Genomic Analysis or structure of the human genome) and beyond Gene Expression (the measure of RNA content, like Her2/neu in breast cancer) to measure the actual proteins themselves.2. Proteomics is trying but still unable to be useful to cancer patients. 3. Some scientists like to do stuff that they consider to be \"cutting edge.\" There is a whole lot of high tech/cutting edge machinery which has been developed to look at Genomic Analysis (structure of the human genome) and Gene Expression Analysis (measuring RNA content), with Protein Expression Analysis (Proteonomics) and Disease Analysis (CT/PET scanning) moving in that direction. Disease Analysis has major limitations (requiring treating the patient to get data).Protein Function Analysis (are proteins present, active or inactive) and Cell Function Analysis (cell culture testing) involve pretty old fashioned technologies and maximum \"art.\" It takes a whole lot of hands on work and experience, which is why some scientists have screwed it up in the past (twenty years ago) and people have not been keen to get into it themselves. But it\\'s like anything else relating to bioengineering, with enough time, attention to detail, experience, and effort, it is possible to make progress and to develop something which is useful.',\n",

This from a new report that links family incidence of lung cancer with the increased probability of those within the same family possibly seeing other types of cancer in their lives.The report also stated that the actual types of cancer developed as the research continued differed between Caucasians and African-Americans.Although the researchers for this report had previously looked at the \"clustering\" of lung cancer in families, this was a bit different as it looked at the connection between lung cancer and predisposition (possibly) of other types of cancers in families -- but outside just lung cancer this time.

       " 'To those knowledgeable about cancer causes, the role of fake (artificial) sweeteners in many beverages these days probably make you not want to drink anything but water. Personally, I banned all soft drinks many years ago regardless of the presence of real or fake sweeteners. It was very hard, yes -- but now after researching the role of Aspartame and other fake sweeteners in the role of cancer, I\\'ll never go back.Which brings us to the might and oddly bizarre FDA. That federal agency again has swept aside the growing evidence of the artificial sweetener Aspartame contributing to cancer. Another study was released this week that showed this connection, but health officials are making excuses once again.Yes, there is the commercial interests at play here (like always) with the sweetener companies themselves, but with so much evidence that connects Aspartame with cancer, it\\'s just amazing a ban has not come forward yet. Comments: 1. Michael Herndon of the FDA keeps saying \"At this time, FDA finds no reason to alter its previous conclusion that aspartame is safe as a general purpose sweetener in food.\" WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM?????Dr. Soffrittiâ\\x80\\x99s new study suggests a danger to unborn babies and especially to children, including the newly identified risk of breast cancer as the child ages. He also believes that aspartame causes leukemia, lymphoma, and pelvis and kidney tumors. He said that his study should be a WAKE UP CALL to the FDA to seriously reconsider the use of aspartame. Dr. Soffritti expressed horror at the fact that aspartame is in approximately 500 drugs.Over the years, many bright, courageous American physicians have warned of many other unwanted side effects of aspartame. Sadly, the Food and Drug Administration continues to support the safety of aspartame because our government watchdog is industryâ\\x80\\x99s lapdog. The FDA totally ignores the toxicity, carcinogenicity and neurodegenerative disabilities caused by aspartame. Many other groups, including the American Council on Science and Health and the Calorie Control Council are nothing but industry supporters. They have absolutely no conscience! Remember that the modern Golden Rule is: He who hath the gold makes the rules!Aspartame causes problems other than cancer. In fact, the FDA admits to reports of 92 symptoms from aspartame.More than 20 years ago, when my daughter was in her early 20\\'s and studying for a Master\\'s Degree, she noticed that she was experiencing bizarre symptoms that were quite alarming.This truly bright girl, whose college tuition was entirely funded by scholarships and who won a Telluride Association Scholarship in competition with more than one million students from the entire US, realized that she was becoming very confused. In addition to her intellectual deterioration and drastic personality change, she developed epileptic-type seizures, and she began to lose her vision in both eyes.She also began having severe headaches, panic attacks, tremors, profound exhaustion, insomnia, suicidal thoughts and numerous other problems including joint pains.My daughter consulted a neurologist, and he told her that she had temporal lobe epilepsy. He began treating her with medication, but the medication didn\\'t work, because the doctor was wrong in his diagnosis and he was treating her for a condition she didn\\'t have! What she really had was ASPARTAME -- POISONING/TOXICITY!I had heard about Dr. H. J. Roberts (Florida), so I contacted him and heconfirmed what I suspected - that she was suffering from a reaction to the artificial sweetener in diet soda, even though she drank only 1 or 2 cans a day. My daughter owes her life to Dr. Roberts, because thanks to him, she stopped drinking diet soda, and gradually, every one of her problems disappeared. Today, she is a successful computer programmer and financial analyst. Dr. Roberts is listed in Who\\'s Who in America, Who\\'s Who in Science and Technology, Who\\'s Who in Medicine and Healthcare, and The Best Doctors in the U.S.To follow up, my daughter went to Boston for special studies on her brain, and the doctors at the Clinical Research Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology confirmed that it was the aspartame that had made her so sick. They said that she had been totally misdiagnosed by the neurologist and that she did not have temporal lobe epilepsy at all. She also saw a highly-respected ophthalmologist who explained why her vision loss was due to aspartame.She was fine for 12 years. Then, she began drinking diet soda again and had the same severe reaction. Luckily, I realized what was happening to her and was able to convince her to stop using aspartame. Why did she start again? It\\'s addictive! (Aspartame has three components: phenylalanine (50 percent), aspartic acid (40 percent) and methanol, also termed wood alcohol (10 percent). Think about the 10 percent of aspartame that is absorbed into the bloodstream as methanol (wood alcohol)! The Environmental Protection Agency defines safe consumption as no more than 7.8 milligrams per day of this dangerous substance. A one-liter beverage, sweetened with aspartame, contains about 56 milligrams of wood alcohol, or eight times the EPA limit!)By approving aspartame, the FDA caused many problems for many innocent people.Aspartame is marketed under names such as NutraSweet, Equal, Equal Measure, Spoonful, Naturataste, Canderal, Benevia, E951, Nutrataste, Joe Sweet, Indulge, Hermesetas Gold (both ace-k and aspartame), Sanecta, and Tri-Sweet. (Crystal-Lite is a beverage mix that contains aspartame.)My daughter\\'s experience was a terrible waste of time and money -- from something as avoidable as diet soda. And, why did it take so long to help her? Because most physicians and their patients are clueless when it comes to connecting the myriad of bizarre symptoms of aspartame poisoning with the consumption of what is supposedly a safe substance - approved by the FDA! Since the FDA says aspartame is \"safe,\" doctors don\\'t notice \"side-effects\" when they are staring them in the eye.All this happened to my daughter 20 years ago, long before I had a computer and could check out aspartame there. I had to spend an entire year writing to doctors and scientists and congressmen to learn about aspartame. I suspected aspartame because I knew it gave me severe classic migraine headaches.As a teacher, I am especially upset when students drink diet soda.In addition to causing other serious health problems, aspartame can definitely have a subtle effect on cognitive functioning and can interfere with the concentration and attention skills of the students.Most students realize that illegal drugs and smoking are bad for them, but many donâ\\x80\\x99t know anything about the hazards of aspartame. With all the media attention on obesity these days, Americans will start using even more â\\x80\\x9cdietâ\\x80? products.Yes, obesity is a serious problem!!! However, what upsets me even more is that people turn to artificial sweeteners in an attempt to lose weight or prevent weight gain. Several important studies have shown that aspartame contributes to weight gain!!! People who lose weight while consuming aspartame are losing only because they have the determination to make proper food choices and to exercise. Government statistics indicated that more than 2.2 million American teenagers experience major depression. The use of antidepressants is skyrocketing. Not always, but very often symptoms of depression are caused by aspartame. Aspartame greatly lowers the Serotonin Level, and, decreased brain serotonin has been associated with depression, anxiety, panic attacks, suicidal attempts, hostility and psychopathic states, as well as hallucinations and insomnia.A group demanding an FDA recall of aspartame has contacted influential people in Washington from the President on down. Thousands and thousands of victims of aspartame wish to have this artificial sweetener banned from the market. All they ever get from the FDA are packages of information claiming that aspartame is â\\x80\\x9csafeâ\\x80? and that the victims are â\\x80\\x9cmistakenâ\\x80? or â\\x80\\x9cover-reacting.â\\x80? I, personally, have seen what aspartame can do to members of my family and friends. I am not â\\x80\\x9cmistakenâ\\x80? or â\\x80\\x9cover-reacting.â\\x80? Some people react quickly to aspartame consumption and others don\\'t realize they have a problem for years. Other people recognize problems, but they have no idea that aspartame is the cause.All Aspartame victims have busy lives. They wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t take their own valuable time to fight to have Aspartame banned from our food supply if they didnâ\\x80\\x99t think it was crucial to the health of the American people and to others all over the world.I would like to quote an Aspartame victim from Great Britain. I recently saw a letter she wrote in which she described herself as a 29-year-old research scientist at the University of Cambridge. She said, â\\x80\\x9cI use hundreds of different chemicals and have been doing so for years without harmful consequences, and yet I was ignorantly poisoning myself every day drinking diet Coke from the drinks machine down the corridor.â\\x80? When she realized that Aspartame was making her sick, she stopped using it. She also said, â\\x80\\x9cMy brain cells are functioning again, and I feel like working and enjoying life again, instead of just going through the motions on Auto Pilot waiting for 7 pm and the end of the day to finish.â\\x80?The FDAâ\\x80\\x99s approval of NutraSweet was very murky in the first place. I think thatâ\\x80\\x99s why the FDA ignores the issue now. In addition, I suspect the manufacturer had enough money and influence to convince everyone of the safety of aspartame. For many years, the FDA refused to approve Aspartame because of the documented seizures and brain tumors it caused in laboratory animals. When President Reagan (a friend of Searle) took office in 1981, he asked the FDA Commissioner to approve it, and the man refused. So, President Reagan fired the FDA Commissioner and appointed Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes to do the deed. There was great opposition, so a Board of Inquiry was set up. The Board said not to approve Aspartame. Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes overruled his own Board of Inquiry and approved Aspartame in dry foods. (Don Rumsfield was President of Searle then.) In 1983, with acting FDA Commissioner Mark Novitch, he approved Aspartame for carbonated beverages, in spite of a thirty-page protest from the National Soft Drink Association asking for a delay of approval until further evaluation verified its safety. Then, when he was under investigation for conflicts of interest, Dr. Hayes went to work for Burson Marstellar, the manufacturerâ\\x80\\x99s public relations firm, for $1,000 a day. In 1993, the FDA approved Aspartame in baked goods, even though they themselves admitted it couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be heated!There are numerous documents that show that the late Dr. Adrian Gross, an FDA toxicologist, and many, many other physicians and scientists, tried to prevent Aspartame from ever being approved. For example, Dr. Gross said, â\\x80\\x9cWe have uncovered serious deficiencies in Searleâ\\x80\\x99s operation and practices which undermined the basis for reliance on Searleâ\\x80\\x99s integrity. . . Searle has not submitted all the facts or experiments to the FDA, retaining unto itself the un-permitted option of filtering, interpreting, and not submitting information . . an attitude of disregard for the FDAâ\\x80\\x99s mission of protection of the public health . . conduct which compromises the scientific integrity of the studies.â\\x80? He also indicated that Searle â\\x80\\x9cdid other terrible things. For instance, animals would develop tumors while they were under study. Well, they would remove these tumors from the animals.â\\x80?Dr. Gross also said, â\\x80\\x9cThe report of the Task Force submitted in March 1976 in essence constituted a stinging indictment of Searle, and it contained various recommendations for regulatory action including referral to the Justice Department for review of possible criminal violations of the law.â\\x80?On January 10, 1977, in a thirty-three page letter, FDA Chief Counsel Richard Merrill recommended to U. S. Attorney Sam Skinner that a grand jury investigate Searle for â\\x80\\x9capparent violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Title 21, Unites States Code Section 331, and the False Reports to Government Act, 18 U.S.C. 1001, for their willful and knowing failure to make reports to the Food and Drug Administration required by Act 21 U.S.C. 355, and for concealing material facts and making false statements in reports of animal studies conducted to establish the safety of Aspartame.â\\x80? It was an open and shut case, so Searleâ\\x80\\x99s lawyers hired the U.S. Prosecutors, Skinner and Conlon, and the case died when the statute of limitations ran out.In 1985, Senator Howard Metzenbaum introduced a bill entitled â\\x80\\x9cAspartame Safety Act of 1985.â\\x80? It required quantity labeling of Aspartame on food items and mandated that there be a moratorium on new uses of Aspartame until independent tests could be conducted under the auspices of the National Institute of Health, since the original studies were the target of an indictment for fraud that was never carried out. Due to heavy Monsanto lobbying, the bill never got out of committee. (Monsanto bought Searle in 1985.)â\\x80\\x9cRetiredâ\\x80? Senator Metzenbaum recently mentioned that he told Dr. David Kessler that the case on Aspartame should be reopened because it never should have been approved. A physician told the FDA that the only responsible action would be to immediately take Aspartame off the market, fully disclose its toxicities, offer full compensation to the injured public, and criminally prosecute anyone who participated in the fraudulent placement of Aspartame in the marketplace as well as those who worked so diligently to keep it on the market. Did Dr. Kessler listen to anyone? No! Without public notification, he approved Aspartame in blanket form in June 1996. He protected the manufacturer by ignoring the FDA register of complaints and its published list of 92 reactions to Aspartame ranging from coma and blindness to seizures and death. In fact, I understand that the FDA has constantly tried to ignore complaints about Aspartame or has at times even refused to accept new ones and by their own admission, has thrown out old ones. After all, the FDA had to show a decrease in complaints in 1996 in order to grant blanket approval. Dr. Kessler said in a JAMA article that only 1% of serious problems are even reported to the FDA. If thatâ\\x80\\x99s the case, why wasnâ\\x80\\x99t he interested in finding out about the other 99% of serious problems before giving blanket approval to Aspartame? The FDA admits to receiving more than 10,000 complaints about aspartame. In the case of aspartame, then, that would balloon the real number to over one million. And, I would like to add that organizations of Aspartame victims are constantly flooded with complaints, even if the FDA isnâ\\x80\\x99t!Apparently, Aspartame did violate the Delaney clauseâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9czero-toleranceâ\\x80? law. The late FDA toxicologist, Dr. Adrian Gross, told Congress that it violated the Delaney Amendment because it triggered brain tumors, astrocytomas , (the first stage of the deadly glioblastoma now said to be rampant in the population ), and his last words were, â\\x80\\x9cand if the FDA violates its own laws, who is left to protect the public?â\\x80? His words are in the Congressional Record.On December 29, 1996, when 60 Minutes aired a program about Dr. John Olneyâ\\x80\\x99s article in the â\\x80\\x9cJournal of Neurologyâ\\x80? questioning a link between brain tumors and Aspartame, Dr. Virginia Weldon appeared on the show to defend NutraSweet/Aspartame. On this program, James Turner, Washington-based attorney, explained that the original studies on Aspartame never proved safety and were never replicated. According to Dr. Ralph Walton on 60 Minutes, independent studies have been done and 83 out of 90 reveal problems with aspartame.The Bressler (1977) report exposed mammary, uterine, and ovarian tumors. James Bressler, leader of the FDA Task Force, said, â\\x80\\x9cThe question you have got to ask yourself is: Because of the importance of this study, why wasnâ\\x80\\x99t greater care taken? The study is highly questionable because of our findings. Why didnâ\\x80\\x99t Searle, with their scientists, closely evaluate this, knowing full well that the whole society, from the youngest to the elderly, from the sick to the unsick . . . will have access to this product.â\\x80?What it all boils down to is that itâ\\x80\\x99s too much of a hassle for anyone in Washington to care. BUT, THAT ISNâ\\x80\\x99T RIGHT! Whatâ\\x80\\x99s done should be Undone! It was the United States that put the poison on the market, and it should be the United States that stops it. Should the entire world look at us and ask why we poisoned the food in all the countries of the world? 2. \"bizarre FDA?\\'\"swept aside the growing evidence\"\"health officials are making excuses once again\"\"commercial interests at play here (like always)\"AND FINALLY\"with so much evidence that connects Aspartame with cancer\"Geez.

It makes you wonder why.\" \"Millions of people are exposed to high doses of aspartame daily, which means we have an enormous amount of observational data in humans,\" he said. \"If aspartame were going to cause a meaningful uptick in human cancers, we\\'ve had a natural experiment -- namely, the continuous tracking of cancer trends by CDC -- to show us that movement of the needle. To date, it has not been seen.\"\"If the investigators examined the incidence of many different types of tumors, one would expect one to two to be significantly increased by chance alone, i.e., random, not real,\" said Susan Fisher, director of the division of epidemiology in the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center.\"\"We know that rats consistently exposed to fairly high doses of aspartame develop more leukemia and lymphoma, although these conditions are common in rats anyway,\" he said. \"For all we know, exposing them to a high daily dose of sugar might do the same.\"<A href=\"http://www.abcnews.go.com/Health/Diet/Story?id=3317079&amp;page=3\" rel=nofollow>http://www.abcnews.go.com/Health/Diet/Story?id=3317079&amp;page=3</A>And, of course, let us not forget who drinks diet sodas?Why, the obese, of course.

       " 'The roles of personal lifestyle choices, exposure to the environment and genetics has always fascinated me as the three-legged stool that provides the overall environment for cancer to begin and grow. The specific role of genetics and possible genetic predispositions to certain types of cancer are just now becoming understood, and the prospects for learning more in this area are becoming quite interesting.In fact, certain molecular \"stages\" have recently been found as a way to mark the development of cancer in general, which could give medical experts the ammunition to devise detections and treatments before cancer becomes more of a problem inside the human body.In medical terms, the growing availability of being able to detect the presence (however small) of cancer cells way before they become a problem is one of the more promising areas of cancer research.

But, this is precisely what is happening in the country of Australia, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.New cases of cancer reached the 106,000 quantity milestone in 2006, and that represents an increase of over 34 percent from just 10 years ago.

Comments: 1. Here we go again. My take on this report: In Australia, between 1983 and 2003, the number of new cancer increased by 26% but this is all explained by population aging; the age-standardized incidence was stable at -0.7%. Brian, why do you find this alarming?Kudos to Australian physicians who decreased the mortality rate by -12%. Overall, they are slowly winning the war on cancer. The report paid extra attention to prostate cancer. There was indeed a large increase in incidence, making it the more frequent cancer in Australia. But this increase is artificial, a consequence of PSA screening. Fig 4.2 shows clearly that, as the incidence peaked in 1994, the mortality started decreasing. In epidemiology jargon, this transient peak in incidence following the introduction of a new screening test is called \"lead time bias\". In the case of prostate cancer, it is compounded by \"overdiagnosis bias\".You see, that\\'s the whole point of cancer screening: more diagnoses, less death. That\\'s good, not bad. ',\n",

In this case, scientists state that the effect can be an enhanced likelihood of prostate cancer.Do vitamins really cause maladies in the body when taken in too high of a dose? More information is needed here before I\\'d think that vitamins are more detrimental than helpful, but then again, low and synergistic formulations are much better than just high doses of redundancy like many commercial vitamins can be. Comments: 1. It seems that users of \"high\" dosages of vitamins develop more prostate cancer and develop more aggressive lethal prostate cancers. Our food is so \"processed\" by the time it gets to our dinner table that much of the so-called \"real\" food in it is gone. Perhaps if food manufacturers wouldn\\'t process out all the vital micronutrients in real food, we could sustain good health and longevity without vitamin and mineral supplements? Bovine growth hormines to speed up the time it takes beef to get to market, steroids to increase the size of chickens, growth factor hormones to increase milk production, mercury in fish, pesticides, and so forth. There is emerging evidence that pharmaceutical EPO can feed the growth of tumors in cancer patients. Afterall, it is a \"growth factor.\" So perhaps vitamins could be \"growth factors\" for tumors also? When you put fertilizer on your lawn, your grass grows better, but so do the weeds.2. You state :\"Anyway, this latest study concluded that too many vitamins actually increases the risk of prostate cancer in men.\"This is not exactly what the study showed.Regular multivitamin use is NOT linked with early or localized prostate cancer. What the study showed was taking too many multivitamins may be associated with an increased risk for ADVANCED or fatal prostate cancers, according to a study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.The association was strongest in men with a family history of prostate cancer and men who also took selenium, beta-carotene or zinc supplements.Remember, this is only an association study. Perhaps those who knew they had prostate cancer in their family took more vitamins to ward it off and they would have gotten it anyway because of the familial link (and there is a strong one).The study was not designed to prove that vitamins affects cancer risk. To prove that, scientists would have to randomly assign half of patients to take supplements and half of men to follow some other regimen.Oh, and there\\'s that nasty beta carotene again.3. Research on epigenetics at Johns Hopkins is proving orthodox oncology wrong about supplements. Evidence from their research suggests that the epigenome can be influenced by the environment which means that epigenetic modifications that lead to carcinogenesis may be reversible by changing the environment.What is meant by environment? The environment is the totality of surrounding conditions - the milieu of the cell. What affects the milieu of the cell? Toxins, viruses, carcinogens, diet, essentially everything that our cells are exposed to. Detoxification followed by the creation of a healthy milieu with appropriate diet and supplements benefits cancer patients.Such a concept is heresy to the orthodoxy within the oncology community that determines research priorities. The viability of detoxification (removing toxins, viruses, carcinogens and other biological contaminants from the body) followed by improving what a patient consumes (organic, whole, vegetarian foods, vitamin supplements, etc.) as a cancer therapy has been summarily rejected by the cancer establishment for decades (most cancer patients are offered artificially colored, sugared and preserved foods during their hospital stays).Despite the growing empiric and anecdotal data that demonstrate that these factors do play a role in distinguishing long-term cancer survivors, the orthodoxy within the oncology community has rejected such treatment approaches as worthless. Part of their reasoning has included that there are no biological mechanisms to support such a modality. However, epigenetics is providing a plausible biological mechanism.Is detoxification and diet a viable cancer modality by itself or in combination with other approaches? There are many long-term survivors who swear it is and offer their existence as proof. What is clear is that our body and the environment are one, as epigenetics proves, the environment can effect how our genes work within our cells.As epigenetics has become an accepted science perhaps it is time researchers took the next step and asked what role epigenetics may play in reversing cancer and what lifestyle decisions and exposures may impact such a role. Perhaps some resources focused on the mechanistic, reductionist and overwhelmingly failed gene therapies can be redirected.4. \"Is detoxification and diet a viable cancer modality by itself or in combination with other approaches? There are many long-term survivors who swear it is and offer their existence as proof.\"That is not proof. An association is not proof. A rooster crowing causes the sun to rise? Anecdotal evidence is not proof.---------------------\"Such a concept is heresy to the orthodoxy within the oncology community that determines research priorities.\"Heresy? Give me the data and we\\'ll buy it.

       " 'It seems like common sense to me -- that lifestyle choices can affect a person\\'s risk for contracting cancer -- but apparently, many people are not aware of this. Or they are aware but are not heeding the advice that might just save them from this life-threatening disease. According to Carolyn \"Bo\" Aldige, president of the Cancer Research and Prevention Foundation, in Alexandria, Va., it\\'s not undiscovered treatments and therapies that are key to fighting off cancer -- it\\'s likely that the toll cancer takes can be reduced by lifestyle changes and routine screenings. Aldige reports that nearly half of all cancer deaths are preventable. And she urges us to consider these facts.   Smoking is the most   preventable cause of death in the United States and causes nearly one in five   deaths, killing about 438,000 Americans each year. Yet 45 million adults still   smoke -- 23 percent of them men and 19 percent of them women.   Poor nutrition, inactivity, and obesity account for one in three of the   564,830 deaths from all cancers. Experts say that excess calories cause   mutations that start genes traveling down pathways that cause cells to divide   out of control -- and that\\'s what cancer is. According to Aldige, if each   person could magically acquire the perfect body mass index, there would be a   whole lot less colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers.   It requires little time and not much discomfort for certain screenings   that can detect cancer at an early enough stage that it can be successfully   treated. There are already screenings for breast cancer, colon cancer,   prostate cancer, testicular cancer, cervical cancer, and skin cancer. And   soon, there may be a simple screening for lung cancer too.   A diet rich in nutrients and vitamin supplements helps maintain health and   prevent cancer. There are some highly effective defenses against cancer -- but they require some attention and effort on the part of each individual. Not everyone will make health-conscious choices -- some for reasons out of their control (lack of access to screenings, for example) and some for reasons I personally do not understand. But maybe that\\'s because I have already had cancer and I know that I don\\'t ever wish for it to return. So for that reason alone, I plan to adhere to the considerations listed above. It seems like common sense to me. Comments: ',\n",
       " 'I remember reading that Barbara Delinsky, novelist and breast cancer survivor, never shared her diagnosis of cancer until well after her fight was over. She feared the news would somehow halt her career in the publishing world. She wanted to remain untainted by disease in the eyes of her readers and bosses so she saved her secret. The secret is out now -- and is also part of a book she wrote called Uplift: Secrets from the Sisterhood of Breast Cancer Survivorship. She is in the clear now -- but she once feared the consequences of managing both cancer and her career.The experts who offer a website resource at cancerandcareers.org believe that it is possible to combine cancer and career without fear or worry or secrecy. The advice provided on this site offers wisdom for working women and for employers and for co-workers. There is also a forum for shared stories -- where all of these individuals weigh in on their experiences. There are reading recommendations and a listing of available programs and services and a complete story about how this all came about.Five years ago, the Board of Directors at Cosmetic Executive Women -- the preeminent nonprofit organization representing women in the U.S. and European beauty industries -- realized that five out of their 40 members had been diagnosed with cancer. Some told their colleagues at work and some did not. But all continued to work and experienced similar challenges. The fact is that work does not stop for all women who have been diagnosed with cancer. So the mission of this group is to help women, their employers, coworkers, and caregivers deal with this problem in the same way that they have learned to deal with problems at work -- strategically, knowledgeably, and effectively. With the right tools, stress and difficulty can be minimized. And this site is one great tool. Comments: ',\n",
       " \"Lori Raimondo set off on a cross country journey in May with the goal of raising $9,490 -- one dollar for every day that her mother battled breast cancer. And just yesterday, she reported that her trek is over, that she is back home in New York City after her amazing adventure in search of hope. I think she found the hope she was looking for because she not only met her goal -- she exceeded it. She raised a grand total of $12,610.90 while traveling 10,334 miles -- and every cent was donated to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation where hope for a cure just got a bit sweeter.Lori coined her trip the Road for a Cure and what a road it was. She crossed many state borders, met charming and kind and outrageous locals, visited with friends along the way, ate at tucked-away restaurants and slept in quaint places, toured roadside stops, and while accompishing her fundraising chronicled it all through words and photographs that appear on her own personal blog. It's inspiring -- that Lori would give of her time and effort and spirit to help others. All in honor of her mother, who lost her battle with breast cancer, and in support of those currently fighting their own battles. I am truly thankful -- as a breast cancer survivor -- that the research that might one day save my life may be a result of Lori's courage and bravery and hard work and generosity.Welcome home, Lori. And congratulations on a road well traveled. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"I am always a bit nervous before I head out for a check-up with my oncologists. I have two of them -- a medical oncologist who delivered my chemotherapy and a radiation oncologist who delivered my radiation therapy. Today I see my radiation oncologist and she will examine my breasts and manipulate my breasts and feel my underarms and check for lymphedema -- swelling in the arm due to removed lymph nodes -- and she will ultimately determine whether or not I have anything to worry about at this time. It's been just over one year since my last radiation treatment and six months since I saw this doctor for a follow-up. So I am a little apprehensive about what I might hear -- because it's always possible that something does not feel right, that something is questionable, that something has returned. I am mostly confident that I am okay but there is still an unknown that lies ahead of me. An unknown that in a matter of a few hours will be known. And I will either learn that I am in fact okay. Or I will begin another spiral into the what-if-it's-cancer scenario. Only time will tell. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'I was examined yesterday by my radiation oncologist and two medical students during a six-month follow-up appointment. And any apprehension I had prior to the visit -- about a recurrence of breast cancer or the detection of cancer somewhere else in my body -- is gone. Because I walked away with the news that I am doing just fine. No lumps or bumps or suspicious masses were found. No enlarged lymph nodes were detected. And since I did not report any pain or tenderness or sensitivity or other trouble, I was sent on my way with nothing more than a notice for a return appointment in another six months. I have other appointments hanging in the balance -- one with my medical oncologist in August and a mammogram in November -- and I am sure hesitation and worry will again sneak into my head. But for now, I can only feel the true exhilaration that comes from truly good news. Like the exhilaration that comes from a breathtaking moment at the ocean -- where the power and beauty of the sea and the sky and the sand is all it takes for one five-year-old boy to feel amazingly free.

       " 'Chemotherapy is a good remedy for killing cancer cells -- and I hope every day that it did its job and killed all cancer cells that may have floated away from my original breast cancer tumor. But one not-so-good side effect of this good remedy is the beating that healthy cells take in the process of this life-saving treatment. It will be a red-letter day when chemotherapy can target only cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells unaffected. And this day may be a bit closer for patients in Taiwan who find they are in the early stages of relapse with nasopharynx cancer. On Wednesday, National Taiwan University Hospital introduced a new high-tech laser procedure -- potassium-titanyl-phosphate or KPT -- to vaporize cancer cells. Doctors use a small endoscopic camera and easily manipulate the laser to precisely eliminate the cancer cells in the back of the nose and the soft roof of the mouth -- without harming healthy cells. The procedure takes roughly 90 minutes and requires a two-day stay in the hospital. This procedure should only be used in the early stages of relapse, though, and first-time cancer patients should still seek chemotherapy. And while those in later stages of relapse can still receive the treatment, it will only relieve discomfort without solving the problem.To date, there have been 16 successful KPT treatments for this disease that about 1,000 people in Taiwan contract each year.

       " 'The topic of weight gets a lot of press -- especially as it relates to cancer. And there is no arguing that the general consensus by all doctors and nutritionists and experts is that obesity and weight gain are key risk factors in the whole game of cancer. And now there are even more statistics to support this belief.According to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, a weight gain of 22 pounds increased a woman\\'s risk of breast cancer by 18 percent. Women who lost the same amount of weight, however, lowered their risk by 57 percent. The study followed 87,000 women between the ages of 30 and 55 for 26 years. Researchers noted how their weight fluctuated after the age of 18 and from menopause and beyond. The study did not count weight gain during pregnancy. Losing weight -- at all ages -- largely decreased the chance of breast cancer. There seems to be no mystery when it comes to weight and health. Higher levels of weight translate into higher levels of risk for all sorts of health problems. And the same goes for breast cancer -- the more excess weight, the more risk. Comments: 1. Thank you for highlighting this very important, but rarely publicized, risk factor for breast cancer. According to a recently published international study on women\\'s awareness of breast cancer risk, \"fewer than 1 in 20 women correctly identified alcohol, exercise or obesity as factors influencing breast cancer.\"EM, in Canada.<A href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2006.03.017\" rel=nofollow>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2006.03.017</A>',\n",
       " 'I was present for death only one time in my 36 years of life. I consider this both a bad and a good thing. It\\'s bad because I did not want my grandmother to die -- and watching it happen made it so real, so vivid, so painful. I don\\'t think I would have ever chosen to watch my grandma die -- to watch her slip from consciousness to coma, to observe her altered body once death arrived, to witness the movement of her body on a stretcher as it was wheeled out of the house from the bedroom I still see every time I visit my mom\\'s house. But I think I am lucky really -- and this is the good part -- because I got to be with her during her final moments. I got to watch her body as it lay still, peaceful and calm and still breathing. I got to talk to her and although she could not respond, I believe she could hear my words. And it makes me happy to know my grandma may have known I was with just prior to her flight to heaven. And after her flight, I got to touch her cool hands. I got to feel the power of the passing of one life -- a long life -- and I got to feel the comfort of a death that was not ugly or painful or difficult. It was sad -- it\\'s still sad -- that my grandma died three years ago.

I don\\'t know this from Susan herself but from her friend, Christy Mack -- who helped her accept her death and guided her into her own final moments so that she could escape her pain and die peacefully. Christy writes about her beautiful friend and her empowering death in an article that appears in the August 2006 Oprah Magazine. Titled Friends to the End, Christy\\'s story details how she soothed her friend, cradled her hand, and talked her through her last breaths.

       " 'It\\'s hard to describe the feelings that overwhelmed me during my bad days with cancer. I could call them consuming and crushing and sickening and frightening and crippling and still not completely cover all the bases. It\\'s much easier to describe the feelings that overwhelmed me on my good days with cancer. I felt -- and still mostly feel this way -- happy and spunky and motivated and invigorated and fulfilled. And I felt loved -- because most of my bad days were turned around by the love of others. It was like clockwork. When I needed it most, a surprise awaited me in my mailbox or my inbox or on on the other side of my front door or on my front porch. These surprises strengthened me on my bad days -- and sometimes beyond the bad days. They still help me really -- because my memory of how they saved me from days of despair continues to fuel my good days. And here are seven of my special surprises.Something Sweet. I love brownies and could probably polish off a whole pan by myself -- which is why I rarely have brownies in my house. So it was a special day when a box of Fairytale Brownies arrived on my doorstep from a friend in Phoenix. Made with all sorts of goodies -- chips and nuts and peanut butter and mint flavors -- these brownies sweetened my day. Something Comfy. Delivered to my mailbox one day was a surprise package containing pretty, soft, cozy, yellow socks -- sent by a friend who wanted me to recover in comfort. I still wear my socks -- and I now buy them for others who need a bit of comfort in their days.Something in Bloom. It was anything but a beautiful, blooming day as I sat for my fourth and last toxic chemotherapy treatment -- until a friend walked through the doors of the infusion center with a vase full of pink, vibrant tulips. My mood turned around. And my day that began with a strong sense of repulsion turned into a day that was brighter than I ever thought it could be.Something Warm. My hand-made quilt was delivered to my front door by three friends and their small children during one of my toxic chemo days. It is pink and lavender and green with names and messages written all over it. It covers me at night and reminds me of the warmth that surrounds me -- the warmth that came from more than 20 friends who volunteered their time and talents so that I could feel better.Something Stuffed. My cousin sent me a small pink stuffed breast cancer bear with a little breast cancer postage stamp replica embroidered on its chest. It is a well-traveled little bear because it began its journey in the hands of a women I have never met and was sent to my cousin who then sent it to me. It sits on my dresser where I can see it every day -- my little bear that traveled many miles to reach me just as I was traveling many miles, reaching for health.Something Donated. My friend who sat with me during my very last Herceptin treatment on June 28 brought me a sweet card with a gift certificate for a pedicure and also the gift of a donation in my name to the charity of my choice. I chose St. Jude\\'s Children\\'s Research Hospital. I also chose to cry when presented this whole package of surprises that brought me so much joy and hope for a better tomorrow -- for me and all those who travel similar cancer roads.Something Written. Cards and e-mails and notes have overwhelmed me, both in number and spirit. For a long time, it was every day that cheerful words came my way. And they truly got me through the day. Now they are not so abundant. But they do tend to surface when I least expect them and when I most need them. A friend -- the same friend who brought me tulips -- left this message for me on my breast cancer blog: Jacki\\'s BeautyHigh above a mountain\\'s green forest rises the peak.Where scraggly rock replaces lush meadowsand thinning air makes the knees grow weak.This is where the bald eagle soars,lifted by a thermal above a barren summit.As I imagine the majesty of this bird\\'s eye view,this is the beauty I feel when I think of you.Thank you for sharing your battle with breast cancer with me.

I hadn\\'t needed one for the past four years because as a stay-at-home mom, my schedule was dictated not by the clock but by the needs of two rowdy little boys. But I got a job at a preschool and now time is very important. I have to be at work on time. I have to attend meetings and events. I have to chart the departures of children.&nbsp; I have to leave my job at a certain time. A watch became necessary and just before my job started, my bracelet arrived in the mail. A perfect gift. Perfect timing. A perfect way to stay in tune with the passage of time. A perfect way to stay motivated on my breast cancer journey.Another charm on my bracelet reads, \"Wherever you go, go with your heart.\" Whenever my bracelet jingles and jangles on my arm, I am reminded to do just this.

The whole ordeal turned his world upside down and he hopes that his story helps others -- primarily men -- who find themselves in a lonely place with the daunting job of caring for the people they love. As a psychologist, Luftig has good insight. And he wishes to help minimize the psychological barriers that prevent men from effectively caring for loved ones during times of serious illness. Luftig shares in his book his realization that while he cannot repair and fix all hard times, he does have some important tools. And his power tools are love, support, and understanding. He has learned to sew joy out of rough cloth. He understands that he cannot shelter his family members from bad times, but he can shoulder their burden. And he now appreciates that all things are not so bad when measured against the yardstick of a life-threatening disease like cancer. Luftig\\'s whole collection of wisdom and lessons and advice fill his book -- and bits and pieces also appear in periodic articles in <EM><A href=\"http://www.copingmag.com/\">Coping</A> magazine. It\\'s worth the read -- and the journey starts <A href=\"http://www.home.earthlink.net/~sashaallie/index.html\">here</A>.',\n",

       " \"In all of my research on breast cancer -- and all of my attempts to discover what I may have done to invite this disease into my body -- I have learned that there are some behavioral risk factors related to cancer. Some risk factors are loosely linked and perhaps need further study. And some are definites. Like smoking. And consistent use of alcohol. Now a new study done on rats now shows that nicotine can reduce blood alcohol concentrations and can lead to heavier drinking. Smoking and drinking -- at the same time -- may be even more dangerous than originally thought.Only two previous studies have examined the interactions between nicotine and alcohol. So there is very little research about how nicotine assists in the metabolizing of alcohol. Until now -- said Wei-Jung Chen, associate professor of neuroscience and experimental therapies at the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center in College Station, Texas. Chen said it was clear in her study that the presence of nicotine significantly reduced peak blood alcohol content. This was observed only when alcohol entered through the stomach -- and not when injected into the abdomen. For humans, this means that people smoking while drinking will have to drink even more to reach the effect they desire. This will ultimately lead to increased amounts of toxic byproducts in the body. And it may prevent absorption of beneficial drugs in some people who both smoke and drink. And I can't imagine that the list of negatives will stop here. But is there really any more information necessary to support the danger of this combination of risky behaviors -- behaviors that on their own are dangerous enough to cause worry and concern.

       " 'Double the hormone, double the risk. Or so says one study of older women who take hormone pills. When estrogen and testosterone are combined, women face twice the chance of getting breast cancer, according to a study of more than 70,000 nurses. This type of combination therapy may help with mood, libido, and bone density -- but the possible risk of breast cancer may just outweigh these benefits. These findings, published in Monday\\'s Archives of Internal Medicine, add to the evidence that certain types of hormone supplements -- like estrogen-progestin pills -- increase risk of breast cancer, strokes, and heart attacks in women. Other research points to a link between breast cancer and high natural levels of testosterone.Women\\'s natural levels of estrogen and testosterone decrease with menopause. Use of supplements has climbed over the past 24 years, perhaps putting more women at more risk. Estrogen-testosterone pills are sold under the brand names Estratest and Estratest H.S. and appear on a Washington-based advocacy group\\'s \"Worst Pills\" list because of breast cancer risk.

       " \"Parents may want to save their kids' baby teeth for more than just nostalgic reasons -- they may want to save them because they are rich in stem cells and the pulp tissue could provide the means to treatment for injuries and disease. BioEden Inc. is a new company out of Austin, Texas pioneering this effort that is so new some doubt science will ever catch up with the expectations of this firm. But President Jeff Johnson says all evidence indicates that baby teeth are a wonderful source of stem cells -- cells that doctors and researchers pursue for their capability of replicating and morphing into specialized cells that can be used to repair the body. Experts think baby teeth stem cells might one day be used for bone, teeth, and even nerve cell regeneration which could hold potential for spinal cord injuries and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.Parents may find brochures in their dentist offices featuring the benefits of banking their children's teeth once they fall out. And pursuing tooth banking is no different than pursuing any other dental procedure. There are fees involved, of course -- banking fees and perhaps referral fees from dental offices -- and other considerations that each parent must weigh. Dr. Phil Hunke, president of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and pediatric dentist for 32 years, says the idea of removing cells and freezing them holds true promise -- and he may want to bank the tooth of a child or grandchild once he learns more. Dr. Kevin Donly, a professor of pediatric dentistry, says he sees some potential but will not be banking teeth for his three little boys. He just doesn't think he's at the point where it's necessary. Another pediatric dentist -- Dr. John Updyke -- believes that if money were not an issue, all parents should bank their kids' teeth. But many young families can't afford the initial $595 and the $89 annual storage cost it requires. And without a solid scientific backing, tooth banking might not come up as a priority for many when it may take 10 years or more to even determine how useful these specific stem cells will be.

       " 'My port -- that thing that pops up from under the skin on my collarbone, that thing that by default stays in place because I can\\'t decide whether or not to remove it -- is now officially in maintenance mode, now that my treatment for breast cancer is complete. My last Herceptin infusion was on June 28. And my first port flush was today. For as long as I keep my port -- and for as long as it has no real use -- I must have it flushed one time each month. So today, I strolled into the cancer infusion center where I\\'ve spent many hours and this time spent just a few minutes -- enough time for my usual chemo nurse to puncture the skin on top of my port, push through a rather large needle, and inject a dose of blood thinner into the lines of the port to keep clots away. The whole procedure was harmless, painless, no big deal at all. And I will return one month from today for a repeat performance.One day these once-a-month visits may become a hassle. After all, I have to find a place for this appointment in my already-busy schedule and find childcare for my kids and find a place to park. I have to numb my port and endure a needle stick and sometimes fight traffic to get home. And the whole trip to and from the cancer center takes longer than the procedure itself. Clearly, this may be a waste of time for a port I don\\'t even need right now. But at the moment, this visit is just what I need while I sort out the details of my post-treatment world. I need to go back to the infusion center. I need the comfort of the drive. I need to feel part of the chemo community. I need medical people swirling around me. I need a bit of hand holding. For now anyway. Comments: 1. This was just what I needed to read to help me feel \"normal.\" I just returned home from my post treatment scans and visit with my oncologist and feel a bit of sadness at my departure.

       " 'Screenings for colorectal cancer offer more than a chance for early treatment -- they offer the chance to avoid cancer completely. The disease usually starts with growths called polyps that can take a decade to turn cancerous. If polyps are found and removed, cancer can be avoided altogether. Yet many are avoiding the screening. And polyps that go undetected can turn to a cancer that can lurk silently in anyone -- especially during middle age and beyond. And black Americans are especially at risk. Almost 42 million Americans over the age of 50 are not getting checked for colorectal cancer -- the nation\\'s No. 2 cancer killer. Perhaps it\\'s the financial burden that comes with the life-saving procedure. Now in five states, a government-funded program is offering free testing for the poor. But still, many will fall through the cracks in many states. And while Medicare pays for screenings, this federal program is for people 65 and older -- a long wait for someone at age 50 who needs the test but does not have insurance. Perhaps it\\'s the part of the body under study that steers people away. Perhaps it\\'s the manner in which the test is performed -- a long, flexible tube is used to visually inspect the colon -- that turns heads in the wrong direction. While the financial burden is a valid deterrent, other worries or fears should be put to rest. The test is not all that bad, says one doctor who had a colonoscopy himself. The worst part of the whole experience may be the liquid mixture that is consumed prior to the test that cleans out the system -- minor discomfort really in the scope of the alternative. Cancer. Colonocopies are recommended just once every 10 years. And nearly 60 percent of deaths from colorectal cancer can be prevented if each person over the age of 50 finds some way to make this screening happen. And if not this screening, there are other options -- like a fecal test that is done annually but is more more affordable and can be quite effective too. So consider your options. And make a choice. Comments: 1. As a nurse i cant stress enough the importance of getting a colonoscopy done at 50. Yeah it may not be the most MANLY thing, but it sure beats dying of colon cancer. I have been in the room as many colonoscopies are performed, yes at the patients side. Its not as bad as it may seem. I have been encouraging all the \"older\" men that i know to buckle down and go get thiers, yet most say no way why the lax attitude? It must be the \"oh that would never happen to me\" view of cancer. ',\n",

Not all bikinis will talk -- but those made by Canadian company Solestrom will. Solestrom has created a new bikini that goes on sale next month with a UV meter built into its belt and an alarm that sounds when it's time to seek shade. The meter on the $190 bikini displays a level of UV intensity on a scale from 0 to 20. Three to five is moderate strength, eight to 10 is very high, and anything above 11 is extreme. A person's sensitivity to UV depends mainly on skin type so this scale operates in general terms.Despite increasing awareness of the sun's dangers, sales remain strong for the bikini. So Solestrom developed this suit to ease some of the worries about the sun's damaging rays. They have already been met with high demand from Australia and South Africa -- where skin cancer rates are highest.

       " 'The topic of my hair is often the subject of conversation -- and is a constant reminder that this brown curly hair I have covering my head is nothing like the straight blond hair I was born with, grew up with, was known for. Because my little boys have white blond hair, I am consistently asked by strangers, \"Where did your boys get that blond hair?\" \"From me,\" is what I want to say because it\\'s the truth -- but that would make no sense to anyone who does not know me, anyone who does not know that my hair -- that once looked much like my boys\\' hair -- was lost to chemotherapy and returned shockingly different. So sometimes I just chuckle in wonder with these strangers who may not expect an answer anyway. Or I tell them the story -- if they seem to really want in on the details of the mystery. Most people are surprised that my hair grew back like it did. I am not surprised -- I was warned that it might happen -- although it is still a startling discovery each time I look in the mirror, each time I look back at photos, each time I see gray hairs emerging through my dark hair -- gray that only slightly showed up in the midst of my blond locks. The memory of my blond hair keeps popping up. My husband told me the other day that he had a dream about me -- I was in a restaurant, at a table, by myself. He was walking toward me. And I had blond hair. The rest of the dream is insignificant. The blond hair is significant. And the other day, I pulled my brush out of my purse. It hasn\\'t been used in more than a year -- because I don\\'t brush my curls at all -- and at the base of the brush, wound around the bristles, were long blond strands of hair. My blond hair.

I like the familiar -- which is why I never wanted to show my bald head, why I covered my head with blond wigs and hats to keep my appearance as close to normal as possible. And then in a strange turn of events, my hair grew back in an unfamiliar fashion -- and somehow the question, \"I see where your boys get that blond hair\" flip-flopped into \"Where did your boys get that blond hair?\" It is all still new to me.

       " \"I wish I could reverse the damage I've already done to my skin after too much time spent in the scorching sun, in search of a tan. It's seems unfair that a tan is so temporary -- yet its damage is everlasting. And it seems crazy that so many people are still searching for a tan -- when it has become so clear that is it so harmful. As many as 60,000 people a year die from too much sun -- mostly from malignant skin cancer -- according to the World Health Organization (WHO). About 48,000 deaths are caused by malignant melanomas, and 12,000 deaths are caused by other kinds of skin cancer. And 90 percent of these cancers are caused by ultraviolet light from the sun. Cancer is not the only side effect of sun exposure, though -- serious sunburn, wrinkling, eye cataracts, growths on the flesh of the eye, cold sores, and other illness can result from the sun. We all need some sun -- the vitamin D that is produced in the body by the sun helps to prevent disease and immune disorders. But too much is dangerous and sometimes deadly. Yet almost all ill effects from the sun can be prevented. And the WHO has released a report that advises people to seek shade, to use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15, and to stay out of tanning salons. The report operates under the premise that sunscreens be used not to prolong sun exposure but to protect the skin when exposure is unavoidable. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"I've been keeping a journal ever since I was first diagnosed with breast cancer. I first wrote by hand in a pink fabric-covered book, sprinkled with multi-colored polka dots. It looked feminine -- which is why I bought it -- and it's vibrance made me feel inspired, motivated, eager to write down the dreaded details of the beginning of my journey. Then I stopped writing in this book and began typing my words in an on-line journal -- a blog. My husband designed the presentation of it, with a pink banner that serves as the backdrop for the title -- my Breast Cancer blog. My first entry was completed on December 21, 2004 and I am still chronicling my journey here. I am also writing for this site -- the Cancer Blog -- and I write whenever and wherever else I can record my words. I do it because it helps me process information in a quiet, calming, introspective way. It soothes me, helps me work through panic and anxiety, helps me heal, and helps me chart my progress. When I look back at what I've written, I realize how far I've come -- or haven't come -- and it helps me move forward. I recommend journaling for everyone, and I recommend these seven simple suggestions for getting started.Style. Your journal can be all-emcompassing and can cover all aspects of life. Or it can be specific. My journal began because of cancer and mostly focuses on this topic. But sometimes I write about parenting and other side issues too. You might keep a food journal, an exercise journal, a memory journal, or a dream journal. Just choose your style and proceed.Format. Any format will do -- writing in a book made specifically for journaling, jotting down thoughts and notes on loose paper, typing an on-going collection of entries, even recording your voice will do just fine. Whatever the mode of expression, the point is creating a record of what is going on in your mind. Rules. There are no rules. You can write every day or you can write once a month. You can use words or drawings or charts and graphs to depict your inner thoughts. Regardless of how you journal -- or how often you journal -- you will accomplish the goal of getting closer to the real you.Censoring. Make sure you record your exact emotions -- no matter how scary or frightening. Don't shelter your thoughts. Don't feel embarrased. And don't worry about spelling and grammar and punctuation. Journaling should not be purposely crafted or manipulated -- it should be real. No one is grading or evaluating or judging you.Privacy. If you are worried that someone will one day read your memoirs, consider a safe hiding place for your journal. Carry it with you at all times. Type an entry and e-mail it to yourself. Or write an entry and then dispose of it. It's the act of writing that is beneficial -- if you are okay with not having a permanent record of what you wrote, then this might be the best route. There are no rules for journaling, after all.Sharing. You might choose to share your journal -- l like I do. My blog is available to anyone who finds me on the internet. I like it this way because I want people to gain insight from my journey, to learn from my experience. Keeping my words private helps me -- but it does no good to anyone else who might benefit from where I've already traveled. In addition to on-line sharing, journals can be saved and passed on to family members. My family has several journals that my grandmother kept before she passed away. Looking back at them allows us to keep her memory fresh in our minds. It reminds us of her unique handwriting. And we learn a lot from her notes too -- she wrote her own life story, for example, that has been copied and distributed to her children and grandchildren. Her legacy lives on through her written words.Reflecting. Permanent journaling is valuable for the purpose of reflection. I often look back on what I've written and mostly feel accomplished for making progress both physically and emotionally. On February 23, 2005, in the midst of chemotherapy, I wrote on my blog:I am still making it through each day without too much difficulty. I am still positive and hopeful. But while I once felt completely motivated and somewhat unphased by breast cancer and its implications, I now feel sickened and a bit angry. I am sure I will someday turn towards acceptance and will one day think of this journey as a life-changing gift. But for now, I just feel sick.Reading this -- and realizing that I have accepted this disease and that I do think of it as a life-changing gift reminds me that I have evolved and changed and emerged from a tunnel of darkness. Journaling has been critical in my recovery and healing. And I intend to continue writing and sharing. For me. For others. Because my life -- for now -- is an open book. Comments: \",\n",

She just recently went public with her breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis after rumors of her demise started circulating. McAleer set the record straight, announcing that she is doing just fine. While her experience has been frightening, she is surviving well -- and she wants the public to know. She has run Elant for 20 years and wants to dispel any myths about its stability. Apple CEO Steve Jobs faced the same public drama in 2004 after surgery for pancreatic cancer and subsequent drops in Apple stock. Jobs recovered -- and so did the stock -- but the speculation that swirled was powerful and potentially damaging. Just as it was that same year when Kraft Foods was criticized for withholding details of its CEO\\'s hospitalization.There is some debate in the business world about all of this -- about whether or not executive illnesses should be disclosed. For public companies, one opinion is that there is an obligation to respond quickly to the public. In a private company, it\\'s up to the CEO. McAleer\\'s Elant is not a publicly traded company and there is no worry about stock price -- but her decision to reveal her personal health crisis was the right thing to do, she says. \"I have an obligation to share this news in how I progress, in order to educate and make sure people aren\\'t frightened by it,\" she said in reference to the memo she sent to her 700 employees and community groups too.I\\'m open and honest about my own cancer experience because I believe it can help others -- and it helps me to talk about it too. So I\\'m a fan of a forthcoming approach in the workplace. I appreciate that some fear repercussions that might result from such a disclosure. But honesty may be the best policy -- for prevention of rumors and addressing worry and raising awareness too. McAleer seems to agree as she takes this opportunity to speak up, to encourage women to seek mammograms and to follow up on them.

       " 'Apple CEO Steve Jobs delivered a commencement speech at Stanford University on June 12, 2005. It was about following curiosity and intuition, about looking back and connecting the dots in life, about beginnings and endings, about death. Jobs, a survivor of pancreatic cancer, knows a thing or two about facing death. And the words he chose to relate his life-threatening experience to a crowd full of hopeful graduates are powerful and inspiring. I could paraphrase his message -- but surely something would be lost in my translation. So here is a bit of what he said -- word for word.When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: \"If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you\\'ll most certainly be right.\" It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: \"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?\" And whenever the answer has been \"No\" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.Remembering that I\\'ll be dead soon is the most important tool I\\'ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn\\'t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor\\'s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you\\'d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I\\'m fine now.This was the closest I\\'ve been to facing death, and I hope its the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don\\'t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life\\'s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.Your time is limited, so don\\'t waste it living someone else\\'s life. Don\\'t be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people\\'s thinking. Don\\'t let the noise of others\\' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.Enough said. Comments: 1. Hi, Im not sure what your name is because the thing does not say. But I am sure happy that you beat a very rare cancer. You are definatley a very lucky man to have had surgery to remove your tumor. My grandma only had pancreas cancer for 4 months and 12 days until she went to be with GOD. She had a good fight though, she never gave up. Believe it or not she was never sick before this, the only time she was ever in the hospital was when she had her kids. I just wanted to tell you that I wish the very best and hope all goes well. God bless you!',\n",
       " \"MTV -- the ultimate source of music videos and pop culture -- has been around for 25 years now. And that amount of time makes for a lot of memories. So in recognition of the entertainment MTV has offered over the years, Indystar.com, Indiana's #1 local media site, takes a walk down memory lane and counts down 25 best MTV memories. It's fitting that many of the memories include actual music -- although some may say MTV is not really about music anymore, with music videos hard to come by -- so Michael Jackson's 1983 14-minute video Thriller makes the list and so does the 1985 performances of Live Aid, a conglomeration of musicians who sang to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia. But many memories are not recollections of music videos -- or even musical performances. They are nostalgic remembrances of other media events -- like a kiss between Madonna and Britney Spears during an award show, the running of the popular Beavis and Butthead show and Remote Control game show, peeks into spring break extravaganzas, and roof-raising reality shows like The Real World and The Osbourne's. And even one socially-conscious piece that aired to raise awareness of testicular cancer. On May 23, 2000, wacky, stunt-pulling comedian Tom Green let viewers into his private world, in an operating room while he underwent surgery to remove a cancerous testicle and several lymph nodes. Green survived the surgery well -- and he is surviving cancer still today -- and his public handling of a serious disease goes down in MTV history as something truly memorable. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"I just purchased my very own End Breast Cancer license plate. For years, the back of my mini-van has displayed a University of Florida plate -- and while I am proud to be a Florida Gator, I am more proud to be a breast cancer survivor. I survived college -- seven whole years of college -- but I fought harder to survive breast cancer. I gave more and endured more and invested more with breast cancer. I feel accomplished and rewarded by this undertaking in a way that doesn't compare to college -- which is quite an undertaking in itself. So this new license plate reflects the me of today -- the me with lumpectomy scars and a port popping up from under my skin and my dark, curly post-chemo hair. Unlike the me of long ago -- with no scars and blond, straight hair bouncing in a ponytail or hanging out the back of a ball cap.&nbsp; My University of Florida license plate suited me then.&nbsp; My breast cancer plate suits me now.The proceeds for my purchase -- just $25 more than a standard Florida plate -- go to the Florida Breast Cancer Coalition Research Foundation, a non-profit grass-roots organization dedicated to the eradication of breast cancer through advocacy, education, and research. Many states feature a breast cancer license plate. The appearance and message written on each plate are different but the purpose is the same -- to raise awareness and funding for the fight against breast cancer.I still have a big Florida Gator sticker on the back of my van.&nbsp; But it now shares space with my pink ribbon magnet and my new license plate too.&nbsp; I am a traveling billboard.&nbsp; And I'm proud of it.

       " 'Coletta Barrett believed her stomach pains were caused by a gall bladder attack after eating greasy fried food. She excused a tightening in her lower abdomen as irritable bowel syndrome, and she explained blood in her stool as a response to stress. Only after a referral to a gastroenterologist led to a colonoscopy did she learn that the upper portion of her colon was almost completely blocked by a large tumor -- a cancerous tumor. Barrett was diagnosed with colon cancer. Her colonoscopy saved her life.Barrett never once predicted she might have colon cancer. She thought the disease mostly struck older people. She was just 42. Screening tests are not even recommended until the age of 50. She had no family history of this cancer and had no typical risk factors associated with the disease. She did not smoke, was not overweight, and drank very little. But she did in fact have colon cancer -- shocking as it was -- and doctors believed her tumor had been growing for 18 months before detected. Fortunately, Barrett learned that her cancer had not spread. And she learned a few other things that she now shares as advice -- from her survivor point of view. These tips come from an article about Barrett in the August 1 Women\\'s Day magazine.   Barrett says, \"know your body.\" And don\\'t ignore or dismiss any changes   that occur.   Don\\'t let embarrassment stop you from seeking help. Some symptoms can be   difficult to discuss -- such as change in size and frequency of bowel   movements, bloody stool, cramping, and bloating -- but still ask your doctor   about them. Early detection is critical, she says.   If diagnosed with colon cancer, learn as much as you can about the disease   -- a well-informed patient has a better chance at a better outcome. Barrett offers sound advice. And I think it is global advice. Knowing your body, discussing symptoms, and education after diagnosis are key for anyone. For everyone. Comments: 1. Ms Barrett\\'s story is a vivid reminder that colon cancer screening saves lives. Do not wait for symptoms to occur, it might be too late then.2. Ninety percent of colon cancers occur in patients over age fifty. So there\\'s little need to get a colonoscopy before age 50 and most insurance cos. will not cover a screening colonsocopy before age 50 for this reason. So, one should pay out of pocket before age 50 when NO SYMPTOMS occur.Also, too many follow-up colonoscopies are done, also straining our system. <A href=\"http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Study_Suggests_Too_Many_Follow-Up_Colonoscopies.asp\" rel=nofollow>http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Study_Suggests_Too_Many_Follow-Up_Colonoscopies.asp</A>The Couric effect is real, but we should not create fear in the public.3.

       " 'On Monday, the sale of a Japanese brand of aloe juice was banned by the Department of Health after it was determined that it contains high levels of benzene -- seven times more than the World Health Organization recommends for maximum levels in water. Benzene is a colorless and flammable liquid with a sweet smell and was once used as an additive in gasoline. It is carcinogenic -- and has been cause for concern worldwide. So samples of the drink, produced by the Japansese cosmetics brand DHC, will be sent to the Bureau of Food and Drug Analysis for further investigation due to such concerns. In the meantime, the sale of this aloe juice, sold in convenience stores and through mail-order, will be suspended. Comments: ',\n",
       " \"Several boxes containing injections of Neulasta have lined the bottom of my refrigerator for more than a year. They are left-overs from chemotherapy -- from a time when one needle pierced the skin on my arm after each chemo treatment to keep my blood counts in a safe range. I've looked at them day after day after day, and I've allowed them to sit in the same exact spot for all this time. But today, they are in the trash -- not because I made a conscious choice to throw them away but because water spilled all over the inside of my refrigerator and left them soggy and damaged. Surely I would not have used them in this condition, I thought -- so I tossed them. But really, I would not have used them anyway. They were old -- probably past their expiration date -- and I am not receiving chemotherapy anymore. I had absolutely no use for them. But I kept them for safety or comfort or some other impractical reason -- for the same reason I keep a basket full of old medication in my kitchen cupboard. It's all cancer-related -- most of it never touched because I don't really like taking medication, even when necessary. So this stock-piling tendency defies all logic for me. Until today -- when part of my past sits in a white trash bag, ready for the curb, and the rest of it is soon to be trashed. So I can continue moving forward. Away from cancer. For good.

       " 'Scientists have determined that mouth cancer develops in two different ways which dictates the seriousness of the disease. This finding, revealed on Tuesday, could lead to better prevention and treatment. In laboratory experiments with healthy, early, and advanced cancer cells, researchers were able to pinpoint differences in the cells that determined the aggressiveness of the cancer. They found faults in the p53 gene, which stops damaged cells from dividing, and in the p16 gene, which helps regulate and prevent cancer from developing. Both changes are linked to more aggressive tumors. This is first-time evidence that some mouth cancer tumors are more aggressive than others and are unfortunately linked to poor patient survival. Oral cancer typically stems from pre-cancerous lesions, changes, or patches in the mouth -- all of which are early signs of cancer. Recognizing which pre-cancerous changes are more likely to develop into aggressive tumors would allow doctors an insight that could help them prescribe the best treatment. Smoking, use of chewing tobacco, and heavy alcohol consumption are the leading causes of mouth cancer. And smoking and drinking are a very dangerous combination. Like lung cancer, mouth cancer usually develops in people age 50 or older. Comments: ',\n",

Her dream came true this weekend when she got the chance to meet Yamin backstage at the \"American Idols Live\" tour in Richmond, Virgina -- Yamin\\'s hometown.Jones, from Jonesboro, Arkansas, is such a fan of Yamin\\'s that in May she camped out at Graceland in Memphis just to catch a glimpse of him when the top Idol contestants were visiting the former home of Elvis.

He went through so much in his childhood, struggled through so much, and in the end, he came out on top. That\\'s what I pray and hope I can do,\" she said. Yamin, 28, is no stranger to health concerns. He suffers from Type 1 diabetes and is also deaf in one ear -- as a result of repeated childhood ear infections and an ear-drum replacement surgery at the age of 13 that just didn\\'t work out right. Still, he overcame his obstacles and has made a name for himself as a talented singer. Jones wants to overcome her obstacles too. For now, though, she is just happy Yamin helped her forget for a moment that she is a kid with leukemia. Comments: ',\n",
       " 'Every time I hear about someone who has died from cancer, it knocks me down a notch. It makes me sad for the person, for the family, for the friends, for me -- because I know I am not guaranteed survival from cancer and while I mostly live each day as if I am immune to this tragic outcome, the knowledge that people do really die from this disease that I am trying to beat is overwhelmingly sobering. And what shakes me most is the fact that these people who die from cancer must have had the same outlook as me at some point in their journey -- the outlook of promise and hope and continued survival. And then something happens that jolts this hope from their grasp. It could happen to me -- and my family and my friends. And that scares me.Sometime last year, my husband told me about a woman in one of his graduate classes whose husband was fighting melanoma that had spread to his brain. He was in year number eight of constant treatment -- both traditional and alternative -- and with each day, his hope for survival was fading. His wife and my husband talked at times about his journey -- and they talked about my journey with breast cancer. And after the class ended, both spouses periodically checked on each other. Today, my husband asked this woman in an e-mail about her husband. She replied and shared that he died last October. She wrote that he could not fight any longer -- that the last chemotherapy he tried to endure was too hard on him. He died with dignity. And she is proud of him. And I can\\'t stop crying.My tears will dry. And sadness will drift from my every thought. And I will return to my usual enthusiastic approach to surviving my own dreaded disease. But in the back of my mind, where I have saved every sad story about cancer and death, my sorrow will linger. And I suppose it should. So I can keep my sights on the possibility that surrounds me -- death -- and so I can continue living with every fiber of my being. Because living is not a guarantee. Ever. Comments: 1. What a powerfull statement. I have been reading these pages and several other blogs, informational sites, and Jacki\"s personal blog for over a year now. My 63 year old mother was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer in February of 2005 and told she had months, possibly weeks to live. There is virtually no information available about this type of cancer. What we did find was not encouraging. Being information junkies and not being able to find much usefull information specific to her diagnosis was uncomfortable to say the least. My sister and I became caregivers and for a whole year. Mom beat the odds, endured Chemo, transfusions, and medications. It was a relatively good year for my mom, and for the rest of us, though the stress was often palpable. In February of 2006 she passed away. The grace with which she handled her illness from diagnosis to her last days with us was inspiring. Exactly 2 months later I, at the age of 45 was diagnosed with breast cancer. I have undergone a mastectomy and am now receiving Chemo. Jacki\\'s blogs give me such comfort. I know that I will survive this but in the back of my mind I also know that we all have limited days. Some of us are more aware of this than others. Cancer has a way of illuminating this awareness. Thank-you for sharing. 2. Thank you for sharing your feelings. I lost my mother to breast cancer last year. My thoughts and prayers are with you.',\n",
       " \"I never colored my hair -- until after cancer, when my once-blond hair lost to chemotherapy grew in mousy brown with touches of gray. I thought it needed some spark and dazzle so I doused my head -- and my bathroom counter and walls too -- with hair dye in an effort to brighten up my look. It worked. And I like it. But I don't like what I've now heard about a possible link between hair dye and cancer. And this is what I told a reporter from the New York Times who called me the other day. She had read my post here on the Cancer Blog about this news story -- about hair dye and cancer -- and she wanted to know more about my personal feelings as a cancer survivor and as a person with colored hair. I told this reporter that it's a bit ironic that in 36 years, I had never applied hair dye to my hair and that only after cancer did I take the plunge -- only to learn that hair dye may be cancer causing. I told her that I wouldn't do it again -- dye my hair -- although I don't think one application of coloring chemicals will really affect me when research indicates a risk only when women use hair dye 12 or more times. But still, I don't choose to take even the smallest of risks when it comes to my health -- which has already been compromised once. I told the reporter that I have not witnessed any widespread panic among the public about this issue. And I think the people I know who color their hair will continue to do so. That's okay with me. Because when it comes down to it, I am responsible for my hair only, my health only, my life only. That's really all I can manage. And once my colored hair grows out -- the colored hair that was photographed today for the story this reporter is writing -- I'll manage to live on with my mousy brown hair with natural gray highlights. It won't have much spark or dazzle. But it will be safe. Comments: \",\n",

They put on their jammies and closed all the blinds and are pretending it's bedtime. But it's actually lunch time, so they have spread out paper plates and plastic silverware and bags of chips and boxes of crackers all over the floor -- on top of all their bedding. I delivered them their lunch platters and lemonade and there they sit, in the room next to me -- chattering away, stuffing their little mouths, full of life. And I am in awe -- of the simple joy that comes from a living room camp-out and picnic, of the beauty these children bring into my life. I am mostly in awe of the fact that no matter what cancer takes from me -- my hair, moments of health, my innocence -- it cannot ever take this very moment from me. And that makes today a happy day.

       " \"I read something yesterday written by a reporter who is fed up with the treatment of celebrities in the media. She is tired of the spectacular headlines about babies born to celebrities and adoptions by celebrities and every-day struggles of celebrities that blur the fact that these same things happen to real people -- non-celebrities -- and are rarely covered in the news. Sure, some of the celebrity coverage may lead to awareness. The fact that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are talking of adopting another child may encourage others in the world to reach out to homeless children. But where is the news about hoards of women who gather and walk in search of a cure for breast cancer? And why was the coming-out announcement by former In Sync band member Lance Bass the top news story on CNN the other day? Because people pay attention to announcements like these -- and however disturbing it may be -- is causes a stir. And perhaps, like this reporter says, others will gain some strength from Bass and will tackle their own sexual orientation more openly. A news story caught my attention the other night. Not because of the news -- initially -- but because of the names that were thrown around. Names like Kelly Ripa and Lindsey Lohan and Molly Shannon -- names that were not all that important in the scheme of the story I would eventually hear. But they hooked me. And then I learned about a great event that took place last Saturday in an effort to raise funds for ovarian cancer. Super Saturday is a day-long summer fundraising event for the entire family -- created by Donna Karan and sponsored by In Style magazine. The day features a designer garage sale with more than 200 designers, a raffle, a carnival for kids, food and refreshments, and goodie bags. All proceeds -- from ticket sales and the garage sale and raffles -- go to the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund. Last year's event raised $2 million. And this year, the tally for the ninth annual event that took place in the Hamptons, is yet to be reported. What was reported is that the event was a success -- and celebrities were in attendance. And that made me pay attention. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'Sadly, another cancer death has occurred -- this one caused by leukemia and ending the life of Arthur Lee. Lee, eccentric singer and guitarist with the 1960s rock band Love, died Thursday at the age of 61. His death was shocking to many who knew him because he had the ability to bounce back from just about everything. Leukemia was usually no exception. But recently, Lee, who was diagnosed this year with acute myeloid leukemia, was not faring well after three rounds of chemotherapy failed. And despite a bone marrow transplant using stem cells from an umbilical cord -- the first of its kind for an adult in Tennessee -- Lee could not overcome cancer.Lee, a Memphis native, called himself \"the first so-called black hippie.\" In 1965, he formed Love -- the first multiracial rock band of the psychedelic era -- and his groundbreaking albums featured a blend of folk rock, blues, and early punk. Lee is remembered for his hit singles My Little Red Book and Revelation, for influencing bands like Led Zeppelin and Echo, and for spending six years in prison during the 1990s for firing a pistol into the air. After his release from prison in 2001, Lee formed a new version of Love and performed in Europe and North America. And then others -- like former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant -- performed for him this June in benefit concerts to raise money to help Lee with his medical bills.Arthur Lee died in at Methodist University Hospital in Memphis -- with his wife Diane at his side.

       " 'I\\'ve been wondering lately about how I might alter my diet in a post-cancer world. I am a moderate eater -- I eat moderate amounts of meat and fruits and vegetables and grains and dairy. And moderate amounts of fats and sweets too. Sometimes I wonder if I am doing myself a disservice by eating meat and processed foods and refined sugar. I\\'ve gathered many opinions that indicate that the further our food comes from the dirt of this Earth, the worse it is for us. That perhaps the increase in cancer cases in the United States is linked to the increase in diets rich in artificial stuff. Part of me resists this speculation -- maybe because I enjoy a variety of foods from the entire food pyramid and I just don\\'t want to give them up.&nbsp; And part of me believes that if this argument is true, then I am a fool to not jump on board and take control of my future health. So I\\'ve taken the first step -- I\\'ve done some research and have located a destination where I could explore this route with detail and precision by practicing a whole new way of eating and being.Hippocrates Health Institute, a leader in the field of natural and complementary health care and education since 1956, teaches a vegan diet with a focus on implementing this lifestyle at home. Food is served in its purest form and is fresh, organic, and enzyme-rich. Food is not the only focus at this institute, however. Whole body healing includes various therapies, exercise, and workshops. While living on the premises of this West Palm Beach, Florida oasis for a minimum of one week and a maximum of three weeks, I could cleanse myself of the toxins and stress and anxiety that have invaded my body as a result of cancer. It\\'s tempting. And maybe when my treatment is complete in August, I will become a student of this philosophy. Just maybe.

       " 'George W. Bush declared five years ago that no federal funding would be allocated for embryonic stem cell research. He has not changed his mind -- and two weeks ago vetoed a bill that would allow this research. He says that supporting the bill would be supporting the taking of innocent human life in order to find medical benefits for others. For Bush, it crosses a moral boundary. But most Americans support stem cell research and would like to see the Bush White House loosen its restrictions, says Kathy Hudson, director of the Genetics and Public Policy Center at Johns Hopkins University in Washington. Until this happens, though, scientists and researchers find themselves in an ethically-charged minefield, operating carefully and responsibly and ethically.Dr. Peter Dirks -- a neurosurgeon specializing in childhood brain cancer at Toronto\\'s Hospital for Sick Children who has been making headlines around the world for isolating brain cancer stem cells two years ago -- is one person weighing in on controversial issue of stem cell research. Dirks does not use embryonic stem cells but instead uses cells from tumors removed during brain surgery that would otherwise be discarded. But he says embryonic stem cell research is critical for his success. It\\'s what has led to the findings that exist today -- and it holds the clues for further discovery. It\\'s a delicate matter, though, regardless of the politics surrounding the issue. Before he harvests stem cells from any patient\\'s brain tumor, for example, Dirks asks parents to sign a three and a half-page consent form. And that\\'s just the beginning.Federally-funded embryonic stem cell research does not yet have its beginning here in the United States. Maybe the tides will change. Maybe we will see progress. Maybe we won\\'t. Only time will tell. Comments: 1. Of course we will see progress. Federal funding has but 2 and 1/2 more years of waiting before starting when a new President takes office.

Opponents of embryonic stem cell research frequently cite David Prentice, a scientist with the conservative Family Research Council, who claims scientific papers prove that adult stem cell lines could be useful treatments for at least 65 diseases. Prentice\\'s research is used to argue that enhanced embryonic stem cell research is unnecessary. However, it\\'s not true.By promoting the falsehood that adult stem cell treatments are already in general use for 65 diseases and injuries, and those who repeat his claims mislead laypeople and cruelly deceive patients. Only 9 of the 65 examples cited by Prentice hold up to scrutiny. As a group of 80 Nobel laureates stated in a letter to Bush last year, current evidence suggests that adult stem cells have markedly restricted differentiation potential.3. The conventional wisdom would lead you to believe that embryonic stem cell research is the most likely to lead to the development of a human pluripotent stem cell. But what if you knew it was already been done. . .in humans. . .with a non-embryonic cell?It has.PrimeCell Therapeutics in Irvine, Calif. did it this spring. The company has taken stem cells from adult males and reprogrammed those cells to pluripotency, and then reprogrammed them again to grow bone, cartilage, brain and heart cells.What if pluripotent stem cells were available --- without t the ethical problems of working with embryos, and also without the other scientific problems as well? They can be.In the fall of 2005, researchers found stem cells in mice and reprogrammed them to become fully pluripotent and successfully reprogrammed them again to differentiate them into many different types of specific cells from all three germ lines. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve done that without the scientific problem of developing teratomas (tumors) that embryonic stem cells have. And because the cells come from your own body, there are no rejection problems or risk of inheriting genetic defects as would occur with embryonic stem cells. But what if this model was scientifically confirmed already? The answer is that it has been confirmed by a group of academic researchers in Germany this spring.However, as we all know, we arenâ\\x80\\x99t really interested in curing mice of their problems. We want to help people. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the hope being promised by the supporters of embryonic stem cell research.But what if we could create fully pluripotent stem cells from non-embryonic cells in humans without the risk of rejection problems? Would everyone still want to spend a lot of time, money and resources trying to find a way to do the very same thing with embryonic stem cells? Probably not. People would want to focus on the technology with the most promise of achieving the goal of helping people the quickest.Forbes.com recently published an article about this breakthrough technology.<A href=\"http://www.forbes.com/home/technology/2006/07/21/stem-cell-research-cz_kd_0721stemcell.html\" rel=nofollow>http://www.forbes.com/home/technology/2006/07/21/stem-cell-research-cz_kd_0721stemcell.html</A>The promise of the future is here today.',\n",
       " 'When I was first diagnosed with breast cancer almost two years ago, my greatest fear was losing my hair. The fear was consuming, painful, over-the-top. That was long ago -- and I survived. I can look back now and realize that the panic about losing my hair was such a small-scale fear -- compared to what I fear now. Now I fear a recurrence of cancer. And it\\'s a whole lot more disabling than a little worry about being bald. I have a few techniques for settling my fears when they get out of control. Sometimes I take deep breaths. Sometimes I distract myself and occupy my mind with something more pleasant than anxiety -- like writing, exercising, playing with my little boys. And sometimes I read about others who have come before me and have handled the same distress I sometimes feel about cancer taking up residence in my body again. Mostly I learn from stories of other women who have survived breast cancer. And I learn that I can handle the fear, that I can handle cancer if it does come back. And the women I find most inspiring are those who have had a recurrence -- or two or three -- and who still manage to happily tackle the life they have in front of them. They give me hope that if a recurrence comes my way, I too can conquer it. And here are seven snippets of hope from the book Hope Lives! The After Breast Cancer Treatment Survival Handbook -- from women who keep on surviving breast cancer.Ann, age 72, diagnosed 1972, 1991 &amp; 1997\"I have had breast cancer three times since 1972. I am a survivor thank God! I do not wish to dwell in the past. I am enjoying life and living fully now.\"Robin, age 38, diagnosed 1996, 1998 &amp; 1999\"Why do I keep going through treatment when there is no permanent cure? I ask myself this every time. There are no options other than death, which to me is not an option. It\\'s not that I fear death. I really don\\'t anymore. I just love life too much to quit. It\\'s a race against time. Treatment buys me time until they come up with new drugs or new ways to treat my illness. I\\'m not quitting.\"Debra, age 43, diagnosed 1991, 1994, 1998 &amp; 1999\"The first three times, I chose chemo and traditional treatments, but it gets harder on my body and my head to keep going back into it. This time, I\\'m going to try some alternative approaches to cancer. My friends think it\\'s because I\\'m giving up and want to die now. I wish they could understand that the treatment is unbearable for me, and with so few choices left, I\\'m choosing a different approach because I want to live now. Not just survive, but live.\"Jan, age 52, diagnosed 1985, 1989 &amp; 1991\"The first time I had breast cancer, I beat it by not allowing it to change my life. The second time, I beat it by not allowing it to change my life. The third time, it changed my life and I allowed it to. Maybe I\\'ll beat it this time.June, age 60, diagnosed 1978 &amp; 1998\"The second time was much less frightening for me because I knew so much more about breast cancer. Knowledge is power, so get informed.\"Margaret, age 51, diagnosed 1990 &amp; 1997\"I\\'ve had both breast cancer and ovarian cancer. I have no breasts and no reproductive system, but I\\'m still very much alive and very much a woman. I am living proof that there is life after cancer treatment. Try to remember that you went through it so you could live. Don\\'t waste time being afraid. LIVE your life!\"Ruth, age 49, diagnosed 1995 &amp; 1999\"Treatment is not as bad this time. My doctor has my side-effect medication adjusted well, and mentally I am not as overwhelmed as when I was originally diagnosed. I wish I had been in remission longer, but I\\'m happy that there are still drugs out there to treat me. I still work, play tennis, and take care of my children. Breast cancer for me is a chronic illness, but one I seem to be able to live with. I am grateful for that, but I pray daily for a cure.\"And this is just a bit of what makes me feel better when the fear of recurrence takes hold of my mind. Comments: ',\n",
       " \"A ninth Hole in the Wall camp is in the works -- thanks to actor Paul Newman who started the first camp for critically-ill children in Connecticut in 1988. Hole in the Wall camps host thousands of children for free and are now scattered all over the map -- in California, New York, France, and other locations. And one will soon open in Israel. Each Hole in the Wall camp is a separate entity with its own distinct personality and name -- like The Victory Junction Gang in Randleman, NC and Camp Boggy Creek in Eustis, Florida. All camps share a common goal of building self-esteem and restoring joy in the lives of seriously-ill kids. And typical camp activities -- for kids whose diagnoses range from cancer to muscular dystrophy -- include rope climbing, face painting, horseback riding, swimming, and sports. It's a typical camp where children can enjoy childhood, without compromising their medical needs, due to state-of-the-art medical care. Newman makes periodic visits to the camps and only partially funds the camps that mostly survive on their own through charitable contributions. He clearly loves the camps that have served more than 100,000 kids from 34 states and 31 countries and says he wants the camps to be the legacy he one day is remembered for. And what a legacy it will be. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'Four-time Iditarod champion Susan Butcher died Saturday of complications from a recent bone marrow transplant. Her health concerns began three years ago when she was diagnosed with polycythemia vera -- a rare disease that causes bone marrow to produce excess blood. Then last winter, she was diagnosed with leukemia. Her subsequent bone marrow transplant on May 16 cleared her system of cancer. But she developed graft-versus-host disease -- where transplanted cells start attacking the digestive system. A fever, a change in her potassium level, and a trip to intensive care prompted her husband to write on his blog Friday of her condition. He reported that if she remained stable, she would return to her previous hospital room and would work on recovering. But sadly, Butcher did not recover.Butcher dominated the 1,100-mile sled-dog race from Anchorage to Nome in the late 1980s and brought national attention to the grueling competition. She won the 1986 race and became the second female champion -- and then won again in 1987, 1988, and 1990. She finished in the top four through 1993. Butcher also made headlines in 1979 when she helped drive the first sled-dog team to the 20,320-foot summit of Mount McKinley -- the highest peak in North America.Butcher, who ran her last Iditarod in 1994, grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts and was married with two daughters -- ages 10 and five. Butcher was 51 years old. Comments: 1. The next time you see snow falling in those large, silent, beautiful, gossimer flakes.

       " \"A reader left a comment the other day on the Cancer Blog post death by cancer dims outlook of promise, hope, survival. It was positive and supportive and inspiring -- and sad too. The reader shared that her mother passed away in February after a year-long battle with gallbladder cancer. She wrote that her mother handled her diagnosis, chemotherapy, transfusions, medications -- and her final days -- with true grace. And this is a big deal. Because there is not much information floating around on the topic of this cancer. So this woman didn't have much to cling to. Like I do. As a breast cancer survivor, I have mounds of resources at my disposal. I have books and magazines and websites and blogs that devote generous coverage to breast cancer. There are walks and runs and yard sales and fashion shows and other fundraisers that make breast cancer survivors the lucky recipients of extensive research and study. I see pink ribbons all over town and license plates on the roads and clothing and hats and even tennis shoes that promote breast cancer awareness. I could go on -- and on and on.Gallbladder cancer is rare. So perhaps that's why there is not an abundance of information on the disease that has no known cause or test to detect its presence in the body. The American Cancer Society estimates that about 8,750 new cases of gallbladder cancer and bile duct cancer (excluding bile ducts within the liver) will be diagnosed in 2006 in the United States. And about 3,260 people will die of these cancers in 2006. Of these new cases and deaths, about half are due to gallbladder cancer, which affects predominantly women and those who are older than 65. Diagnosis of this cancer is difficult because symptoms do not often surface until the late stages when aggressive treatment becomes necessary. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy are typical treatment tools, along with palliative therapy to help control or reduce symptoms. There are also drugs currently under study in the areas of both targeted therapy and immunotherapy. It's good to know that gallbladder cancer is rare -- and that it takes far fewer lives than breast cancer and other diseases -- but for the unfortunate ones who are diagnosed with this life-threatening illness, the lack of information and resources is a truly an unfortunate side effect. Comments: 1. I can personally echo the comments here about the pain of receiving a diagnosis of gallbladder cancer and the difficulty of finding information about such a rare cancer. I was diagnosed two months ago, and I have spent endless hours online trying to locate information; it's very difficult to come by. I have just created a blog to describe my experience, and what I have learned, to provide a resource for others who are seeking informaiton about the disease.The ACS statistics cited anticipate more gallbladder cases the website did just two months ago. I wonder if the numbers are really increasing. Thanks for featuring gallbladder cancer; it helps to break the silence about the disease.\",\n",
       " 'It may be possible to learn happiness -- like we might learn to cook or learn to dance -- by merely taking a class. Some refute this idea and believe you can\\'t actually pursue happiness. You either have it or you don\\'t. But some psychologists are embracing a whole new approach to psychology -- they call it positive psychology -- and they say it focuses on training the mind to focus on the past as very positive. It\\'s completely different from traditional psychology where time is spent trying to determine why someone is so horribly sad. This movement, invented by University of Pennsylvania psychologist Martin Seligman in 1998 when he was president of the American Psychological Association, provides a scientific validated set of exercises -- known as interventions -- that lead happiness seekers to their ultimate destination.Sherrod Ballentine is one happiness seeker who took a one-day course called Authentic Happiness and How to Obtain It. She continued on with a six-month class on the same subject and is now completing exercises like writing and reciting a gratitude letter to a friend and jotting down three happy events of each day. Ballentine, who was not clinically depressed but wanted to kick up her spirits a notch, says she has found true happiness. \"Every day, I feel grateful to wake up this way,\" she says.Seligman, who is ironically a gloomy, depressive, pessimistic person, compares happiness coaching to fitness training. He thinks about fitness centers where people are sweating for physical health and he imagines a little room called a well-being center where he walks clients through six to ten weeks of happiness training. People would only pay if they are happier in the end. Others say promoting this philosophy is not such a great idea. People who already feel bad will need to shoulder the burden of feeling defective for feeling bad, says another psychologist. But Seligman says it\\'s old-fashion science really. Happy people don\\'t just feel better -- they are also healthier and live longer and are more productive. And that alone is worth pursuing.The entire January 2000 issue of the American Psychological Association journal is devoted to positive psychology. Last October, 350 psychologists from 23 countries attended the seventh annual Positive Psychology Summit. The next summit -- this fall -- is cosponsored by Toyota. There is a new journal called Journal of Happiness Studies. An article, Shiny Happy People, appears in the August 2006 Discover magazine. And Seligman has several best-selling books, like Authentic Happiness and Learned Optimism. It is clear that there is a future for positive psychology. And those who support it say the attention this movement is getting is positively overdue. Comments: ',\n",
       " 'I recently learned that the CBS website features a whole section of public service announcements about various topics -- such as child abduction, depression, HIV/AIDS, menopause, osteoporosis, and heart disease. But what first caught my eye when I was visiting this site was the topic of breast cancer -- because this is the disease I am fighting. And then I spotted a section about colorectal cancer. I was intrigued about a television network\\'s commitment to public health issues. So I kept reading and learned a thing or two about the CBS Cares initiative -- that is also delivered through television spots.I learned that hundreds of hours have been spent researching each featured subject. And I learned that experts in each field have been consulted and interviewed for accurate and up-to-date information. I found that the basics of each topic are included on the website as well as detailed information that viewers might not otherwise know. For breast cancer, readers can learn about breast cancer in general, about early detection, and about risk factors. And there are video clips of celebrity spokespeople -- like Marg Helgenberger and Melina Kanakaredes -- who share their voices on the topic. For colorectal cancer, readers can gain insight into the prevalence of the disease by region. They can learn about polyps, about warning signs, about treatment options, and about survival rates. And celebrities Stockard Channing and Charles S. Dutton voice their messages about this disease. Doctor interviews and information from the American Cancer Society are sprinkled into the content of these very thorough, informative, and enlightening pages. Dr. Jay Winsten, Associate Dean and Director of the Frank Stanton Center at the Harvard School of Public Health says, \"It is truly unprecedented for a television network to create a website that draws so extensively and effectively on the expertise of numerous world-leaders in pubic health research.\" And now, CBS has set the precedent.

       " 'Kids can be so positive and encouraging, even in the face of sickness. Now today my kids have just a simple sickness -- nothing life-threatening -- that I\\'m sure will pass in a day or so. They are throwing up every content of their little tummies -- even sips of water -- and they are pale and lethargic and run-down. But still, they have hope for a brighter tomorrow. This morning, five-year-old Joey said to me while resting in my bed and just after he threw up , \"this is just the good getting rid of the bad.\" He went on to explain how the good in our bodies knows when to push the bad out. And this is what is happening to him today, he said. He is throwing up the bad so the good can take over. Simple. Easy. Makes sense. I never saw my own sickness like this. Instead of visualizing chemotherapy as a good agent that kills bad cells, I was repulsed by the horrific liquids that poisoned my body. I knew of people who were able to turn chemotherapy into a Pac-Man game -- with Pac Man chomping away at the cancer cells and leaving nothing but healthy cells to thrive. And I knew people who were relieved to feel sick because it meant the chemotherapy was working. I never saw it like this -- although I do know that chemotherapy may have saved me from a life with cancer. I was discouraged by chemotherapy. I had a negative attitude about it, and I had to really gear up for all of my infusions. I still -- more than one year later -- cannot eat anything I ate on my chemo days. The mere thought of these foods makes me feel ill.A pediatrician friend of mine told me that kids with cancer tend to be positive. There are a few old souls, she said, but for the most part, they continue to tackle life with spirit and adventure and simplicity. Like my boys today who are peacefully napping at the moment so everything good in their bodies can come back with a vengeance. Comments: 1. My 6 year old son has been fighting cancer since he was 2.

       " 'In the past year, I have had three severe skin reactions characterized by red, itchy, burning bumps that start on my chest and without fail climb over my shoulders and onto my back. They last for a few weeks, are irritated by the Florida heat, and have had no known cause -- until today when I visited my dermatologist for a skin cancer screening and briefed her on this bizarre condition that has kept me away from sunscreen and out of the swimming pool and in hiding from the sun. I have suspected that sunscreen, chlorine, the sun -- or some combination of the three -- have been my potential irritants. So I\\'ve been avoiding them altogether. But I learned today that the sunscreen and the chlorine are not to blame. That leaves the sun, which is the most likely culprit -- and only because I have received chemotherapy with one very toxic drug. Adriamycin.My dermatologist told me about a phenomenon called UV Recall that is associated with Adriamycin. Apparently the toxicity of this drug, even though administered long ago, can be recalled, causing a reaction when the UV rays of the sun soak into my skin. Sunscreen may help, my doctor told me, but she cautioned me that it is just a screen -- it does not offer full protection. And she said the best suncreen option would include zinc oxide. I think for me, though, staying out of the sun is my best bet. It\\'s not ideal -- it means I will remain on the fringe of the swimming pool, hiding in the shade, while my boys swim their little hearts out. And tropical vacations will be off my wish list. And I will seek outdoor fun mostly after the sun goes down. But this is okay -- I knew there were long-term side effects of chemotherapy drugs.

It listed step-by-step instructions for completing a self-breast exam. I paid no real attention to this sign, took my shower, and went on with my day filled with classes and friends. I was 19 years old and believed breast cancer was no concern for me at this young age. I'm sure I believed breast cancer would never be a concern for me at all -- ever.I found my own lump in the shower 18 months ago -- a small, pea-sized, hard lump that I felt when washing and examining myself for anything out-of-the-ordinary. I think of that placard often and hope more young women are paying attention to these life-saving tips.A friend asked me recently to help him locate these signs for the college students he works with. I found them, thanks to the Susan G.

       " 'I am an expert in the game of what-if. I guess it\\'s because my recent what if this hard lump in my breast is cancer worry turned into Oh My God, it is cancer that I am so polished at this exercise in all things irrational. Sure, some worries will be fulfilled by reality but for the most part, things turn out okay. But still, I worry. When a bone hurt in my arm last year, I was sure it was bone cancer. It wasn\\'t. When I felt a soft bump on the roof of my mouth, I whisked myself to the dentist for my mouth cancer diagnosis. It was just a little bit of inflammation, probably from a cold. A headache landed me in a tube for a scan of my head. It revealed nothing interesting, and ibuprofen fixed me right up. And lately, I am checking every mole, freckle, spot, speck, and discoloration that adorns my fair skin. I asked about each of these what-if marks yesterday at my annual skin cancer screening. Surprise -- nothing is wrong with me. But all unfounded fears aside, there is some method to my madness about skin cancer because I have had several bad burns in my life, have spent too many hours in the sun in search of a tan, and have already had a few pre-cancerous spots removed from my skin. So I do plan to monitor my skin -- just maybe not every day -- for the ABCDs of melanoma. And you should too -- because melanoma is the deadliest of skin cancers, and it is known for spreading, which makes treatment essential. So consider these what-ifs when screening yourself for skin cancer.What if a spot on my skin is Asymmetrical? This means that one half of the mark on your skin does not match the other half. See your dermatologist.What if the Border of the spot is irregular? This means that the edges are ragged, notched, or blurred. See your dermatologist.What if the Color of the spot is not uniform? This means that shades of tan, brown, and black are present. Dashes of red, white, and blue add to the mottled appearance. See your dermatologist.What if the Diameter is more than 6 millimeters? This is about the size of a pencil eraser. Any growth of any mole should also be of concern. See your dermatologist.It is estimated that 44,000 Americans will develop melanoma annually. Of these people, 7,300 will die. But the death rate is declining -- because patients are seeking help earlier. Perhaps the ABCDs of melanoma are helping. I hope they help you -- and me too.

       " 'Suzanne Pleshette\\'s agent reported on Friday that the actress is currently undergoing treatment for lung cancer. The cancer was discovered during a routine X-ray and was no bigger than a grain of sand. Pleshette apparently feels very lucky and is in great spirits as she receives outpatient chemotherapy at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center -- where the cancer was diagnosed. Pleshette, 69, is best known for her 1970s role as wife Emily on The Bob Newhart Show. Her other television credits include 8 Simple Rules and Will &amp; Grace. She has appeared in the films If It\\'s Tuesday This Must Be Belgium and Oh God! Book II. And her raspy voice has been featured on several animated films.Pleshette has been married to Tom Poston, 84, since 2001. Poston costarred with Pleshette on The Bob Newhart Show.  Comments: 1. Grain of sand?Particles that range from about 2 mm down to about 0.05 mm in diameter are called sand.Spiral CT, a technology introduced in the 1990s, can pick up tumors well under 1 centimeter (cm) in size, while routine chest X-rays detect tumors about 1 to 2 cm in size. Size and survival advantage:Preliminary data from screening protocols suggest that smaller lesions are likely to represent earlier stage and potentially more curable disease. Of the 27 cancers detected in the Early Lung Cancer Action Project,[12] 22 were pathologic stage IA; of the 15 cancers &lt; 1 cm in size, only 2 were found to have lymph node metastases. Furthermore, the propensity of tumors to metastasize is likely to be proportional to their size. Ishida et al[13] found the incidence of lymph node spread to be 38% for tumors &gt; 2 cm, 17% for tumors between 1 cm and 2 cm, and nearly zero in lesions &lt; 1cm.This study provides preliminary support for the theory that size may correlate to some degree with biology and that small lesions do represent early stage disease. It provides some reassurance that there may be a size threshold below which there is minimal or reduced risk of tumor metastases. <A href=\"http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/464462_4\" rel=nofollow>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/464462_4</A>',\n",
       " 'Hair colorist Jason Backe hopes hair dye does not cause cancer -- because he is covered in it every day in the Manhattan hair salon where he works. But the topic of hair dye and cancer has been on his mind lately -- because he has been fielding questions from clients about the possible link between the two ever since an American Journal of Epidemiology study was released and caused nationwide panic about hair dye upping the odds that women might contract lymphoma -- a cancer of the lymphatic system. But on Thursday, a New York Times article summed up opinions from both experts and hair stylists, revealing that most everyone believes this panic is not necessary. Recent studies found that those who had ever used hair dye were 1.19 times more likely to get lymphoma than those who had never used it. Those who colored their hair before 1980 -- before then-questionable chemicals were removed from hair dyes -- were 1.39 more times likely to get the disease. Ann Curry on the Today Show said, \"These are scary numbers,\" but Dr. Barnett Kramer, associate director for disease prevention at the National Institute of Health said, \"Compared to risk factors for other diseases, those numbers are very small.\" Smoking makes people 10 to 60 more times likely to get lung cancer. According to Dr. Joseph K. McLaughlin, president of the International Epidemiology institute, if these numbers are true -- and that\\'s a big if -- it would mean that using hair dye may present a remote risk to your health. But it would still be less risky than crossing a street, driving a car, not wearing a seat belt, or drunk driving. I am not exactly in a panic about this whole issue. But before I heard the news about hair dye and cancer, I did dye my hair -- once. And I don\\'t think I will do it again -- even though the risk may be small -- because I have already had cancer. And any amount of risk associated with any type of cancer is just something I don\\'t want to mess with.

       " 'It\\'s kind of a blur how exactly I came to receive a phone call from a volunteer at the American Cancer Society just after my breast cancer diagnosis. I must have checked a box on one of many medical forms shuffled my way during this confusing time. Or I requested assistance from someone, somewhere, at some point in time. I\\'m not really sure. But I am sure of this -- one very nice woman, a young breast cancer survivor herself, called me one afternoon from the Reach to Recovery program. She asked me about my situation, told me of hers, and led me to resources -- other survivors, support groups, and the fitness group Team Survivor -- and she met me one afternoon with a goodie bag full of information and comforting gifts. She was my first link to the world of breast cancer survivors.I\\'ve come to know this woman in different circles since she first called me. She was a physical therapist at the same center where I received therapy for post-surgery and radiation concerns. She has been present at every walk and fitness event and cancer function I have attended. And she leads the local Team Survivor group -- so I receive e-mails from her about all sorts of events and gatherings and opportunities for joining a spirited group of strong women. And just today, I received an e-mail invitation from her -- intended for all young survivors she knows who might be interested in becoming Reach for Recovery volunteers. I replied instantly. Yes, I want to do it. She happily replied. So in a short time, I will receive training for this very important job.It\\'s not a hard job -- it just requires some phone calls and a few personal visits. And the ability to share advice. And words of wisdom. And love and care and compassion for those who may not know how to manage during a personal brush with breast cancer. Whether facing a possible breast cancer diagnosis, a new diagnosis, or a troubling time with lymphedema or reconstruction, Reach to Recovery volunteers offer a hand to anyone grasping for assistance. I must have been grasping during my own difficult time. I just don\\'t remember much about that time. All I know is that someone helped me at a critical time. And now it\\'s my turn to be that someone. Comments: 1. I, too, was contacted by a wonderful woman right after my breast cancer surgery. She was a life-saver, as I knew no one who had had breast cancer that i could talk with. She came to my house, answered many of my many questions, encouraged me and told me I could win the fight against cancer. I vowed that day that when I got well, that I would contact Reach To Recovery and become a volunteer. I have been cancer free now for 1 1/2 years. I take my training as a Reach To Recover volunteer Aug. 26th. I look forward to sharing \"life\" with other women and let them know they, too, can win their fight against cancer. Thanks for your article.',\n",
       " 'Cancer has helped me slow down -- a little. I am more patient in the moment without racing to the next task I think is waiting for me. I can better manage my priorities and can offer the most important things the majority of my time. I am better at passing on opportunities that are low on my wish list. And I can typically say \"no\" if I don\\'t have the time or energy to devote to a request. I know that I have to be healthy and happy and fulfilled in order to operate effectively and joyfully in this world. So I try to enjoy peaceful moments and put priorities first and not overextend myself and slow down. I\\'m not completely there -- yet. But I plan to keep practicing. And I\\'m going to try these seven strategies -- offered by a freelance writer, wife, mother of two, and reformed over-committer -- in an article I stumbled across in a local family magazine I picked up this week.Meet your physical needs first. This means sleeping and eating right and exercising. They are all essential for ensuring you are efficient and focused on extra tasks.Take time to check your calendar. Requesting time to review your schedule before committing to a task allows you time to ask yourself if you can comfortably fit the activity -- and complete it -- into your life. If you determine it does fit, you can enthusiastically commit. If it doesn\\'t fit, you can confidently decline due to prior committments.Overestimate. Try to overestimate the amount of time a task will take and then ask yourself if you\\'re still willing to do it. Try to under promise and over deliver. Instead a promising a task in two days, commit to one week. When you finish in four days, the requester will be thrilled -- and you will feel less stress.Seek comfort. Make sure you are comfortable with what you are giving up to commit to the request.Take care of you. Consciously fill the time you would otherwise spend overcommitting with your own self care. Once you realize that saying \"no\" could allow you time to go to the gym or take a long walk, declining becomes easier.Let go of guilt. Only you can define what contributes to your unique and necessary life balance. Do what is right for you so you can be happy doing what you choose to do.Practice makes perfect -- or maybe perfection is not all the important. But striving for sanity is. And feeling sane is one of my top goals. So I intend to step in the right direction by practicing these seven strategies. Comments: ',\n",
       " 'I don\\'t take for granted that I am alive. I am fully aware of it, consciously grateful for it, continually amazed by it. Before I was confronted with breast cancer, I still knew I could die -- in a car accident maybe -- but I thought chances were pretty good that I would make it to a ripe old age. Death was never at the forefront of my mind. I had no reason to believe that life could be snatched from me. And because of this, I am sure some pretty important moments slipped by me, virtually unnoticed. But now -- after a breast cancer diagnosis, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and then more therapy, I realize life is not a guarantee for anyone. Me included. Even at age 36, I am not safe. I feel confident about my future -- and I believe cancer has left my body -- but my life has been threatened like never before. And that makes me wake up and take notice -- really notice -- the moments that are too important to take for granted. My first baby boy starts kindergarten today. Before cancer, this still would have been a monumental day for us both. But now, after cancer, it\\'s even bigger. Because I know of several moms who did not survive cancer long enough to see their children walk through their first classroom doors -- moms who thought, like me, that they would surely beat cancer and would see their kids off for every first day of school. So I am lucky to have made it to this day -- to witness the wonder of my sweet, shy, sensitive, challenging, demanding, loving boy as he leaves the comfort of home for the real world. Two days ago, my littlest guy said, \"Mommy, I love you and want to keep you forever.\" Joey -- the boy whose wisdom should guide him right through his first day of school -- said, \"Danny, you can\\'t have mommy forever. One day she will die, and you will never see her again.\" Fortunately, his harsh meaning was lost on three-year-old Danny who kept playing with whatever toy was occupying him at the time. But his meaning was not lost on me. He spoke the truth. And so I plan to soak up the kindergarten moment this morning -- and photograph it and write about it and cherish it for my days to come. And in two years, I hope to do it again with Danny as he starts off on the same path. With me by his side. Comments: 1. I have never thought of the \"other\" side of this kind of milestone. Last year I sent my five-year old cancer kid to kindergarten - so happy that he was still alive to reach this milestone. Today he should have started first grade but was getting platelets instead. I am so wrapped up in childhood cancer that I hadn\\'t thought of the milestones from the point of view of a parent with cancer - each similar and poignant in different ways. ',\n",
       " \"Lynne began her blog on August 6 -- one week ago and two months after she endured surgery to clear a clogged bile duct and received the grim and frightening diagnosis of gallbladder cancer. Her cancer is stage IV -- not an uncommon staging for a hard-to-detect disease that many will only survive for two to six months. So Lynne is scared but still strong and hopeful and full of faith. Her goal is to live -- not die -- with cancer, even though her days may be numbered. So Lynne blogs her thoughts and fears and all the bits and pieces of information she gathers about a disease that is rare and resources that are scare. It helps her. And it will surely help others. And here is a glimpse into what she shared in her first post.If you had only six months or a year to live, would you want to know? What would you do with the information? Would it make a difference in how you lived your life? These are questions I have been asking for the past two months. In asking them, I have also noticed how little guidance there is for this process. Who have I known personally who was able to anticipate their death? I can think of only two individuals, and I never asked them whether or not they were living differently in their awareness of their mortality.So, those are the themes in this blog. I look forward to a dialog with those I know, and those I don't about this strange, life changing journey.To Lynne -- and to all others who are faced with the disease -- may you find peace and comfort and strength in every step you take, every direction you follow, every path that becomes your road to recovery. Comments: 1. Jackie, thanks for the link. I think this blog will help many. The cancer is rare and there is so little information available that every little bit helps. Connecting with others who have some knowledge or experience can be worth so much. I wish Lynne all the best and look forward to following her story. 2. Hi, I'm the Lynne who started the blog two months ago, and I wanted to provide a quick update on my disease. Contrary to the experience of many diagnosed with gallbladder cancer, where the disease progresses rapidly, I have not had further spread. I am surprised, relieved, and delighted to find myself feeling good and having almost normal energy four and 1/2 months post diagnosis, when I thought I might be on death's door. I say this to provide hope to others newly diagnosed with this rare cancer. Thanks for providing this link and information, Jackie!\",\n",
       " 'I have heard the term chemobrain many times -- even here at The Cancer Blog when Dalene wrote about it. And I\\'ve started using the terminology myself -- to explain my new-found odd behavior. Like when I put a carton of ice cream in the refrigerator with no recollection of it. And when I took a cap off a pen, couldn\\'t find it, and discovered it on top of an egg carton in the refrigerator. I don\\'t think this is a refrigerator theme -- just a coincidence -- because I\\'ve also lost a clipboard at work, forgotten to hand a guest her glass of water immediately after I prepared it, lost library books and movies, and failed to remember responsibilities time and time again. This may seem like minor forgetfulness -- this is what my oncologist believes may be at work -- but for me, this is odd. I have always had a good memory, have always delivered on my promises, and have never felt as scattered as I do now. So I call it chemobrain -- a good excuse, I figure -- and am now trying to determine what exactly this word means. My oncologist tells me he doesn\\'t really like this term. He thinks it puts a negative spin on regular functioning. He believes those of us who have experienced chemotherapy look more closely at our post-chemo behavior and may interpret quirky stuff as more serious than it is. It probably existed before chemotherapy, he says. But now, we are more sensitive to it and find chemotherapy a good explanation. He may be right. But for me, something in my head has definitely been altered.One patient advocate for Hurricane Voices: A Breast Cancer Foundation believes that something doesn\\'t have to be scientifically proven to exist. And while chemobrain may not be completely proven, there are still studies that support its existence -- which manifests itself through aging-type memory problems, forgetfulness, distraction, and loss of the ability to calculate quickly. Some studies show that 20 to 30 percent of women who undergo chemotherapy for breast cancer, and some who receive similar treatment for lymphoma, score lower than average on mental function tests for as long as 10 years after chemotherapy. \\'\\'There\\'s enough data now to at least know it\\'s a real effect,\\'\\' said Dr. Ian F. Tannock, a psychiatrist who has studied this issue at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto. Some suggest that typical aging may be at fault -- and for premenopausal women who may be rushed into menopause, this effect may be due to hormonal issues. Regardless, it seems to stem from chemotherapy -- somehow. And somehow, this topic needs more attention, more research, and maybe a more positive name. Comments: 1. Chemobrain is indeed very real. It is \"estimated\" that maybe one in five people who undergo chemotherapy will experience what many cancer survivors frequently refer to as \"chemobrain\" or \"chemofog.\" One study from the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center found that \"standard-dose\" chemotherapy can negatively impact functioning of cancer survivors up to 10 years after treatment. Eighty-five percent of the study participants received only one type of chemotherapy regimen.There are a number of theories as to why chemobrain may occur. One is that some types of chemotherapy can cross the blood/brain barrier. Another is that the cognitive problems are created by free radicals, the toxic elements that many types of chemotherapy produce. And yet another is that some people have a genetic background that makes them more susceptible to the effects of chemotherapy. Most likely it is not just one factor but many factors that combine to set the stage for chemobrain to occur.As the search for the cause of chemobrain continues, researchers have begun looking at ways to alleviate its impact. Studies have explored whether Ritalin, which is used to improve fatigue, or Procrit, which increases red blood cell count to improve energy can improve cognitive functioning.Developing coping strategies such as making lists, using a tape recorder, carrying a personal calendar or diary, or taking notes during conversations can also be helpful. Doing puzzles to stimulate your mind may be helpful. So can reducing stress, which not only can result from such cognitive problems but can also cause them, may also be helpful. Meditation and yoga may offer benefits as well.',\n",
       " 'MTV is currently airing another installment of the Real World/Road Rules Challenge reality show. This season -- called Fresh Meat -- pairs former show contestants with individuals who have never before appeared on any MTV reality show. These new contestants -- the fresh meat -- compete with the veterans in tense and strenuous physical and mental challenges for an array of prizes and for a grand award of $250,000. Winning the money could be life-changing for any one of these participants. But for one woman, it could also be life-saving.Diem Brown, 25, was cast on the MTV challenge show before hearing her diagnosis of ovarian cancer. She didn\\'t want to regret passing on the opportunity so with two chemotherapy treatments completed and armed with medication to manage nausea and other side effects, she packed her bags and headed for Australia where her days consisted of challenging stunts and tough competition. She survived it all -- although fatigue and pain sometimes slowed her down -- and she is busy surviving ovarian cancer too. Brown has started a foundation called Live for the Challenge -- kind of like a Make-A-Wish Foundation for patients who are stuggling with medical difficulties. And her own personal wish is that ovarian cancer -- \"the disease that whispers\" -- would get a megaphone to attract more attention and more research. Because one in 50 women will get ovarian cancer and with no accurate screening for this disease, it leads to tragic outcomes for many women.It is clear that Brown is one tough contender -- both on TV and in her everyday life. And that makes her a winner no matter what. Comments: ',\n",

       " 'Less than one year ago, Rep. John P. \"Jack\" Murtha, D-Pa., came crashing onto the national scene with his opinion that the U.S. military could accomplish nothing more in Iraq and should be pulled out of the war zone. It was a harsh opinion -- and one his Democratic partners thought might hurt their party at a time when they were trying to gain control of Congress. The fact that the Democrats had been seen as weak on national security didn\\'t help. And then a funny thing happened.Murtha, 74 -- a decorated Marine and the first combat veteran of the Vietnam War elected to the House of Representatives -- became one of the most popular Democrats around, despite or maybe because of his passionate beliefs. Once a behind-the-scenes kind of man, he is now in the public eye. He\\'s out raising money for Democrats in many states. He\\'s attending fundraising events with Al Gore and others. And he\\'s gathering allies at every turn. And while he still faces opposition, he believes that he must make public what he stands for. And so he does. And because of his recent uncharacteristic charismatic presence, details about this once-to-himself man are emerging. Details like these: A local airport is named for him. An institute for the study of neuroscience and pain is named for him. And a breast cancer center bears the name of his wife, Joyce.The Joyce Murtha Breast Care Center at Windber Medical Center opened its doors in February 2002. Located in Windber, Pennsylvania, this center began as a collaboration between Walter Reed Army Medical Center and Windber Medical Center and ever since its beginning has offered full diagnostic services for breast health and disease in one convenient location.Murtha is surely raising awareness with his opinion about the military and national security and war. And even breast cancer gets a little press out of the whole frenzy surrounding this man and his efforts. Which reminds me that somehow, breast cancer seems to touch the lives of just about everyone is some way.  Comments: ',\n",
       " 'Just before my chemotherapy for breast cancer started -- when I was fantastically frightened by the toxic drugs that were about to drip into my veins -- I was told by doctors, nurses, survivors, friends that I would be just fine. I was young and strong and tough. I would easily tolerate the beating my body was about to take. This is what I was told and actually came to believe myself. I had no other choice really than to approach chemotherapy with a fighter mentality. And so I did. And I did pretty well for my first three doses of Adriamycin and Cytoxan -- given every two weeks instead of three in a dose-dense fashion -- followed by one injection of Neulasta 24 hours later to maintain normal blood counts. And then something happened. And I did not end up tolerating the chemotherapy my gut told me was a scary endeavor.One week after my fourth dose of chemotherapy and after my shot of Neulasta, my body plummeted. My skin lost its color. My energy disappeared. My mind was foggy. My thoughts and words seemed incoherent. My temperature rose. And my white blood counts dipped to 700 -- 4,000-10,000 is normal. I landed in the hospital, spent five days on IV antibiotics to fight off infection, and received a blood transfusion to replenish my blood supply that would not recover on its own. And then for two weeks, I was better. Until my blood counts dropped again -- this time to 1,200 -- and my fever returned and new symptoms surfaced too. Like sore gums and a sore throat and a headache.It was somewhat of a mystery at the time -- why my body crashed a second time after my first hospital stay -- when I had not received any further chemotherapy. My doctor arrived at the opinion that it was delayed reaction to chemotherapy. And maybe it\\'s just that simple. Maybe it\\'s not a mystery after all. Maybe chemotherapy is just hard stuff and there\\'s no real prediction for how it will affect the body -- or for how long. Maybe it\\'s just the price I paid for consenting to a treatment that is now believed to strike harder those who are younger than 64. I was 34.A study released on Tuesday marks the first of its kind for attempting to calculate the real-world risks of chemotherapy for 35,000 breast cancer patients under age 64. Researchers studied a massive database of insurance claims to determine how often breast cancer patients under 64 were hospitalized in the year after diagnosis and how often chemotherapy side effects were blamed. They found that 16 percent of these patients needed hospital care for serious side effects -- more than previously thought. Some side effects, like infection, low blood counts, dehydration, and nausea, occurred three to four times more often than earlier research predicted.For some reason, chemotherapy strikes young women harder than older women. And in the ultimate of strikes, many women do not even need chemotherapy. Surgery, radiation, and hormone treatment may be enough. But there is no way to accurately determine who will benefit from chemotherapy so in the spirit of caution, chemotherapy is over-prescribed. And the price -- hospitalization -- is high. But if we can survive chemotherapy -- like I did -- then perhaps it will also save our lives. Comments: 1. This is a very important study. The news story was well written. You have to wonder about what the study addressed. Published clinical trials enroll the \"best\" patients. What really happens when less than the best patients are enrolled?With respect to toxicity and efficacy, most studies purport to show a benefit of one form of chemotherapy versus another that show really minuscule benefits. For instance, A/C + Taxol versus A/C alone required a randomized trial in thousands of patients to show a minuscule improvement.If the \"real world\" side effects are so markedly greater than reported in the clinical trials, it could well be that in the \"real world\" the putatively improved chemotherapy is actually worse than the \"old fashion\" chemotherapy, if, as in the case of A/C + Taxol, the putatively improved chemotherapy is more toxic, more than canceling out the putative benefits seen in the \"non-real world\" setting.And if the A/C is resistant to the tumor? What do you think happens?2. Chemotherapy is offered to women and the women are told that the benefit to survival may be only one or two percent.In this situation, it is completely up to the patient. It is prescribed after the patient is informed of the minimal benefit.The researchers concluded that side effects associated with chemotherapy may be more frequent than previously thought for younger women with breast cancer. However, these side effects must be weighed against the improved survival gained, however minimal, by chemotherapy for certain women with breast cancer.3. I think oncologists tend to undermine the side effects of chemotherapy and thereby misrepresent the seriousness of the treatment. I also believe they tend to minimize side effects when they are reported. I believe the attempt is to give patients reasons to begin and continue treatment and not disrupt or derail that process, unless in an emergency. This is much like some might do with a little leaguer you want to toughen up and have stick with baseball. This circumstance though is much different and much more serious. Yes chemotherapy may be essential and the physician may not want to say anything that may cause a patient to reconsider, but this approach is not the answer either. The results are that patients are confused by their own bodies and perhaps not seeking medical care when needed. Also, their reality is not being legitimized and acknowledged. As a \"younger\" woman, breast cancer survivor I had reactions to chemotherapy severe enough that I vowed repeatedly that I would never again have chemotherapy under any circumstances. I still don\\'t know what I would do if it was \"required\". I never was hospitalized, but had the symptoms occurred without chemotherapy, I would have gone to the hospital numerous times. As a social worker, I believe womens\\' chemotherapy side effects are being treated much as womens\\' depression was treated many years ago, a kind of patronizing dismissal. Women in or considering chemotherapy don\\'t need mind games, they need respect, honesty, compassion, and a reality check. 4. Surgery is very important for chemotherapy having any chance at working. It is likely that surgical skill is a more important determinant of prognosis than the aggressive nature of the cancer or its stage at diagnosis.The line of reasoning frequently used to explain the value of surgery is that surgery is thought to remove resistant clones of tumor cells and thus decrease the likelihood of the early onset of drug resistance.The removal of large masses likely to be associated with poorly vascularized areas of tumor improves the probability of delivering adequate drug doses to the remaining cancer cells.The higher growth fraction in better vascularized small masses enhanced the effect of chemotherapy. Smaller masses require fewer cycles of chemotherapy and thus decreased the likelihood of drug resistance.Removal of bulky disease enhances the immune system.Surgery is an integral part of the multimodality treatment of many cancers. It is believed the reason for better survival for patients who undergo complete resection without any tumor left behind.',\n",
       " 'When I first looked at my pathology report more than 18 months ago, it made little sense. Terms like Bloom Richardson Score and margins and Her2Neu were as foreign to me as the breast cancer that somehow invaded my body. So I read it over and over again and was eventually able to identify the basic meaning hidden within the four pages that detailed my disease. As it turned out, this report was my map. It led me in various directions for various treatments. It contained some roadblocks. It was sometimes confusing. And sometimes I got lost. There were some good and not-so-good stops along the way. And in the end, I reached my final destination -- in the land survival. And this is where I hope to stay. For a long time.My map is not necessary anymore -- although I still look back at it. I\\'ve found that it makes more sense now that time has passed. I can interpret it more objectively, with more perspective and less emotion and fear. I am still learning about the disease that was removed from my breast. And I am realizing there was a lot I never really knew -- like these seven subjects -- when breast cancer was new and fresh and debilitating.   My tumor was 1.1 centimeter is size. I had no spread to lymph nodes. My   cancer was called stage 1. This was the easiest material to digest. But it   still meant that cancer faced me, and it was enough to scare me. Now I realize   that these three characteristics are pretty good. My tumor was fairly small.   It did not spread. It was found at the earliest stage. Not bad -- except that   I was 34 at the time. One doctor told me, \"A good tumor in a young woman is   still a bad tumor.\" But with the passage of time, even this frightening   statement is something I can take in stride.   I knew I had invasive ductal carcinoma -- yet that meant nothing to me. It   was only a name, a title. Now I know that about 86 percent of breast cancers   start in the ducts and about 70 percent of breast cancer cases are just like   mine. I\\'ve learned that the word invasive -- while a bit scary -- only means   that the cancer has grown out of the duct where it started and into the   surrounding tissue. And I know now that it\\'s not the type of cancer that   determines prognosis -- it\\'s the size. And my tumor was fairly small.   I have learned that cancer cells may look aggressive -- mine did -- but   that they may just appear that way. There\\'s no way to predict if they will   actually act aggressively. Well-differentiated cells are closest to normal,   poorly-differentiated cells are most wild-looking, and   moderately-differentiated cells are in between. Most women have either   moderately or poorly-differentiated cells but can still survive well.   It took me a long time to figure out the Bloom-Richardson Score that was   listed on my pathology report as grade 2 (score 7). This is a commonly-used   scoring system based on certain features of the cell. A score in the range of   3-5 is grade one. Range 6-7 is grade two. And range 8-9 is grade three. Grade   three is the highest and supposedly the most aggressive -- but the features   are all very subjective, and one comparison of pathologists\\' scores on the   same cancer showed they agreed only 75 percent of the time.   My report told me that my margins were clear. This means there was no   cancer found at the margins of the tissue that was removed. Sometimes when a   tumor is removed in more than one piece, it\\'s hard to tell if the margins are   clear. And pathologists can only do representative samples -- to do all of   them would require thousands of slides. So margins are clear is just   an estimated guess -- it\\'s just an attempt at predicting whether or not cancer   still remains in the patient\\'s breast.   Estrogen and progesterone receptor tests reveal how the tumor is behaving.   Mine were both negative -- so my tumor was not fueled by hormones. In general,   tumors that are hormone sensitive are slower growing and carry with them a   better prognosis. Premenopausal women -- like me -- tend to be negative on   both counts while postmenopausal women tend to be positive. Some women may be   negative on one and positive on the other. And those who find themselves in   the positive category respond to hormone blocking treatments. I do not.    Another measurement looks for overexpression -- too many copies -- of   Her2Neu which is one of the dominant oncogenes that contribute to cancer.   One-third of invasive cancers have this tendency. Mine did. And this road on   my map led me to treatment with Herceptin -- which at the time of my diagnosis   was still a questionable drug. Now it seems to be the possible wonder drug for   women like me who are Her2Neu positive. What I\\'ve learned most by looking back at what first overwhelmed me is that there are no real definites with breast cancer. There are estimations and guesses and opinions -- but there is no one indication of how anyone will fare with this disease. Which can be a good thing -- because it opens the door for hope. It allows us to set aside statistics and predictions and to live fully without worry about the scary numbers that appear on a pathology report. So maybe one doctor\\'s opinion is that \"a good tumor in a young woman is still a bad tumor.\" But there is always room for exception. There is always room for hope. So I am letting go of my pathology report for now. I\\'m packing it away in my box of breast cancer stuff. And I\\'m hanging on to hope. Comments: 1. Excellent Post Jacki2.

       " \"After my breast cancer diagnosis, I received endless offers from friends and family who offered to help me. I was offered meals, babysitting, errands, escorts to appointments, and two faraway friends even told me they would hop on a plane in an instant to come stay with me. I accepted a tiny bit of help -- like a meal here and there and a morning of babysitting -- but I really did not want much assistance. Mostly because I am do-it-myself type of person and however unhealthy this can be -- especially in the midst of a health crisis -- I wanted my life to remain as normal as possible. And if that meant taking care of my kids, despite nausea and fatigue, I wanted to do it. I wanted to be the one in the driver's seat on my way to treatments and procedures. And I wanted to run my own errands. Part of me believed that accepting help meant I was really sick. And I couldn't admit that. Yet it was true. I was sick. I needed help.And I need help now too -- while I am healthy and strong and able to do everything for myself. And maybe that's why I am able to ask for it -- because it doesn't require my confession that something in my life is not alright. And actually, asking for this type of help helps me express that I am really okay, that I am able to use my health to help others.I sent an e-mail to about 100 people recently. Each person who received my e-mail is connected to me in some way, and each person somehow has been involved in my personal healing. Many are those who offered to help long ago but whose offers were not accepted. But now I happily allow them all to help -- by pledging a donation in support of me as I prepare to run in the third annual Making Strides Against Breast Walk in Gainesville, Florida. Last year -- my first time participating -- I was stunned by the amount of financial support that flowed my way. I raised $3,500 when my original goal was just $500. So I guess it should be no shock to me that just 24 hours after sending my e-mail this year that I have already raised more than $550. I am amazed. I am in awe. I am bursting at the seams with gratitude that so many people would open their wallets because I asked for help. I had no idea how much power rested quietly in my e-mail address book. Now I know. I know that all those offers of help -- most now two years old -- still stand. I know that the people in my life are caring, loving, generous souls who truly do want to help, if just given the chance. And I know that their help will not only benefit me -- a survivor hoping that additional funds will help locate a cure for a horrible disease -- but so many other women too. Mostly, I know that asking for help can be empowering, uplifting, strengthening, and unbelievably comforting. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"The University of Miami's first basketball All-American and member of the school's Athletic Hall of Fame died Friday of esophageal and colon cancer. Dick Hickox, a 5-6 guard who led the 1959-60 Hurricanes to a 23-3 record and a No. 8 ranking -- still the school's highest -- was 68 years old.Hickox never meant to play basketball at UM. He went to Coral Gables with a friend who was homesick and who threatened to leave unless coach Bruce Hale brought in Hickox and a another friend. Hale agreed -- and had no idea what he was getting. Hickox averaged 22.1 points that season and went on to make history. He was named second All-American, alongside Providence guard Lenny Wilkens. Hickox drew crowds of 5,000 and celebrities -- like actors Burt Reynolds, George Hamilton, and then-Cassius Clay -- often cheered him on from under the basket.Hickox spent his adult years working in the Dade County Public School system and was the business manager of the South Miami High athletic department. In March, he attended the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament in Greensboro, N.C., and received a Legends Award. It was the best basketball weekend of his life, one friend said.Hickox is survived by his wife, his son, and his daughter. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'In the moment of despair, the cliche time heals all wounds may seem anything but comforting. But that\\'s because it\\'s true. It takes time to heal and we are not in the right frame of mind just as something unfortunate has happened to accept -- or believe -- this advice that might come flowing from a well-wisher\\'s lips. It\\'s popular wisdom. It\\'s commonly offered as comfort. It\\'s easy to spit out. And while our wounds do not exactly fade with the passage of time, we are able to put a more positive spin on them. But it\\'s tough to appreciate this until the unfortunate moment is long gone.According to a recent study -- summarized in the September 2006 Ladies Home Journal magazine -- memories of distressing events, like the death of a loved one, don\\'t go away but they do gradually get colored by more hopeful emotions. As time passes, we tend to remember strongly emotional experiences as positive even if they were once harrowing. \"People are resilient,\" says one researcher. \"We come to terms with our experiences in as positive a way as we can.\" So we may eventually see the death of a friend as something that made us stronger, something that reminds us to treasure our friendships. Our ability to find such meaning in the saddest of times helps transform it into a valuable experience -- and not just a sad one.And this is exactly how I feel about having had cancer. No one could have convinced me at the time of my diagnosis that time would heal my wounds. I wasn\\'t even sure how much time I had left on this planet. I was panic-stricken and frightened and tended to defeat conventional wisdom. But now that two years worth of time has passed me by and I am pretty certain I will continue surviving for a long time, I realize time is responsible for my positive outlook. Time did not completely heal my wounds -- I still have days when my wounds are raw -- but it surely bandaged them. And so I do believe time heals all wounds -- in a way -- and I am thankful for each moment of time I have to marvel at this truth. Comments: 1. Ah! Mother Time. Pain of loss is so intense. You learn to live with it, you get accustomed to it, you accommodate it. But eventually, Mother Time becomes a factor. She eventually heals the wound, but the scar will always remain. And as you say Jacki, while the wound does not exactly fade with the passage of time, we are able to put a more positive spin on it.When it comes time for us to find out all that happened to our loved-one and why, many times we may think our thoughts are our own, but more often than not, they emanate from our passed on loved-ones. Through these thoughts, the best parts of our creative character come forth. They are intermingled within our own world.2.

The pain of survival guilt. My brother died yesterday after a short and painful bout with lymphoma and lung cancer. Today I feel his pain, and mine, all over again. My childhood days of Lutheran guilt return; asking why am I here and what in the name of who have \"succumbed before me\" - am I to do - to make a difference in the world?Maybe it just will take - more time?

I got exactly what doctors thought I needed -- without worry about availability or funding or politics. I am lucky. Some in the UK are not so lucky.Two targeted therapies for bowel cancer will not be used in Britain\\'s state-run health system, according to NICE -- the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. NICE, the country\\'s financial watchdog, determined the high cost of the medicines meant their use was not compatible with the best use of resources. Patients are angry because these same two drugs -- Avastin and Erbitux -- are used widely in the United States and in much of Europe. And while neither drug offers a cure for bowel cancer, both treatments have been shown in clinical trials to extend life expectancy by four or five months in some patients. Based on doses given during the trials, it is estimated that the average cost of treating one patient with Avastin would be around 16,800 pounds and with Erbitux -- about 11,700 pounds. Apparently, this is too much. But according to Hilary Whittaker of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer, the decision to deprive patients of this medication is a scandal. I agree. And for these patients, I am sad. Comments: 1. Quoting with URL supplied:Dr. Roy Herbst, at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, says the price of biotech drugs has forced the subject of cost into his discussions with colleagues for the first time.\"If we lost $30 million a year on Avastin, those are things that couldn\\'t go into research and support programs,\" he says.<A href=\"http://www.hometownannapolis.com/cgi-bin/read/2006/08_20-06/LIF\" rel=nofollow>http://www.hometownannapolis.com/cgi-bin/read/2006/08_20-06/LIF</A>2. According to NCI\\'s March 31, 2006 official cancer information website on \"state of the art\" chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, it is unclear whether single-agent chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy is preferable for first-line treatment. At this time, no data support the superiority of any particular regimen.As the number of possible treatment options supported by completed randomized clinical trials increases, the scientific literature becomes increasingly vague for guiding physicians. So, it would appear that published reports of clinical trials provide precious little in the way of guidance. Almost any combination therapy is acceptable in the treatment of cancer these days.The needed change in the \"war on cancer\" will not be on the types of drugs being developed, but on the understanding of the drugs we have. There are over one hundred different therapeutic drug regimens, and some four hundred are in the pipeline. Any one or combination of them can help cancer patients. The system is overloaded with drugs and under loaded with wisdom and expertise for using them.3. It is shocking to me that a course of treatment should cost 16,800 pounds and 11,700 pounds (~ $25K &amp; $18K) for one person. I wonder how much the stuff costs to make? Given that all the possible treatments for all the possible ailments would break the bank of any nation, lines will have be drawn somewhere. My understanding of NICE is that it\\'s job is to strike a balance between expense and benefit of treatments of all sorts. I suspect it is a circle that can never be squared.My father was treated successfully for bowel cancer by the NHS more than 10 years ago, so I\\'ve got a lot to be grateful for. However, if I had bowel cancer now, with a limited life expectancy maybe I wouldn\\'t be quite as dispassionate about this subject.4. \"Translating fundamental insights into the development of commercial products\" is exactly what the drug industry does. It\\'s very hard to do, it\\'s very risky, and it costs a hell of a lot of money.Antibodies are actually a lot more expensive to produce than small molecules. Getting reproducible purity and performance from them is a completely different problem than with small synthetic molecules, and once made, they\\'re significantly harder to formulate, store, and handle. (That\\'s one reason why Iressa, for example, is cheaper by a factor of ten than Erbitux.)Unfortunately, the only way to find that out was to go ahead and spend the money and time to develop them, and take them all the way through clinical trials and regulatory approval. That\\'s when you find out that your wonder drug isn\\'t as wonderful as you\\'d hoped. We\\'re going to have to stop taking the stance that every patient has to get every last shot at survival.

Andy. You would also be shockingly surprised that the treatment your father had for bowel cancer ten years ago would most likely not be any worse than any of the newer, expensive drugs of today. And with much lower toxicity levels, probably a preferred treatment as they have fewer side effects. The only clear conclusion by objective reviewers is that after more than 20 years of empiric trials, there is no clear and meaningful advantage associated with any form of therapy ever examined in any of these trials.',\n",

Block says firefighters are between two and four times more likely to develop certain cancers, and Stevens is the fifth Edmonton firefighter to die of cancer since 2004.

On September 15 at 9:00 AM I will report to the basement of Shands Hospital at the University of Florida where I will be doped into a semi-conscious state and wheeled into an operating room. Doctors and nurses will open the skin near my collarbone and while watching their own procedure on a monitor hanging overhead will remove my port and all connected tubing. They will close my skin, leaving an incision that will quickly become a scar -- and a physical reminder of the cancer than once settled into my breast and the drugs that ran through my veins in search of it.

       " 'I guess it was my decision to remove my port -- now that my chemotherapy is over and there is no more treatment in store for me -- that prompted a surge of worry deep in my gut. A worry that is heightened today about an odd spot of tissue in my left breast that my oncologist told me one week ago was nothing to worry about, was probably just scar tissue from the lumpectomy that was performed in just about the same location as this spot. For one week, I have tried to be okay with this assessment -- that it is nothing to worry about -- but this is not in my nature really. Especially since my first lump -- the one that turned out to be cancer -- was also nothing to worry about, according to a few doctors. But a mammogram and ultrasound determined otherwise and prompted my two-year journey with treatment for breast cancer. And now that my journey is slowing and approaching a stop and my port is ready to come out, I am worried about something that just does not feel right. So I made a call to the medical person who knows how to steer me through the system, and I will soon get a mammogram and ultrasound to figure out exactly what is going on.

With its backing from celebrities like Melissa Etheridge and Sheryl Crow and Kylie Minogue -- all breast cancer survivors who are speaking out and raising awareness -- breast cancer has burst onto the media scene and is receiving powerful, positive attention. Kylie Minogue's public diagnosis spurred so many women into getting their breasts checked that the Medical Journal of Australia reports a 40 percent increase in bookings for mammograms. But sometimes, celebrity diagnoses don't elicit a response at all.Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last month -- yet the announcement barely registered on the public's radar. Perhaps he does not command the same kind of reaction as pop singers do. Or perhaps it's the type of cancer that keeps his public battle on the sidelines.The breasts are a visible icon of femininity -- out in the forefront for all to see. And so the issue of breast cancer is in the forefront. The pancreas, on the other hand, are hidden behind the stomach and are out of sight -- and out of mind. When Apple chief executive Steve Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2004, he didn't even know where to find his pancreas. And so this organ does not attract much fanfare -- and therefore does not attract the funding and research that breast cancer does. Which is sad because this cancer is not just hidden inside the body. It's also a hidden killer. It can't be felt like breasts can be felt. And there is no easy way to detect it, like with mammogram and other imaging techniques. Often a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer -- the fourth leading cause of cancer death in Western societies -- comes with a death sentence. And more and more, breast cancer diagnoses come with promising expectations of survival. We may not know as much as about pancreatic cancer as we do breast cancer. But there are some behaviors that may contribute to this deadly disease. So in the spirit of prevention, consider this:   If nobody smoked, 25 percent of pancreatic cancer cases wouldn't happen.   Alcohol consumption can increase the risk by 15 times.   Some studies link high meat consumption and low vegetable consumption to   incidences of pancreatic cancer.   Folate, the B vitamin in green leafy vegetables, oranges, legumes, and   whole grains seem to reduce the risk. But folate supplements don't seem to   have the same healthy effect.  Comments: \",\n",

And yet if it ever does, I think my goal would be to keep my child's life as childlike as possible -- as hard as it may be while confronting serious life-and-death issues.Camp Fantastic -- set high in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia -- is one place where kids can be kids. At least for one night. Each year for longer than anyone can remember, volunteers sponsor an evening fiesta with dancing, swimming, games, rides, gifts, and fun for 100 children with cancer. This event, known as Rappahannock Night, because of the camp's location in Rappahannock county, is sponsored by organizations that join efforts to allow children to step back from their diseases and soak up the pleasure of friendship with others who share their experiences.Camp Fantasic offers kids moments of pure joy -- away from the rigors of cancer and treatment.

       " \"Sometimes drinking alcohol is healthy. And sometimes drinking alcohol is harmful. Studies show that one drink per day -- compared with no drinking at all -- can reduce a woman's risk for heart disease and stroke by 50 percent. And other research indicates that older women who drink moderately have better cognitive skills. But there are also downsides for women who drink even moderate amounts of alcohol. Even as little as one-half drink per day increases the risk of breast cancer -- possibly because alcohol raises estrogen blood levels which can promote growth of breast tumors. Women are also more likely than men to become dependent on alcohol and to experience other consequences too -- including damage to the brain and other organs. One in 13 adults in the United States has a serious alcohol problem -- and at least six million of these adults are women. And because the risk for alcohol-related health issues increase with age, older women should be especially careful of their alcohol intake for the purpose of maintaining health and limiting the odds of a breast cancer diagnosis. In the interest of balancing the healthful and harmful effects of alcohol, The Harvard Women's Health Watch suggests that women over the age of 65 limit themselves to one drink per day. Or less.

I stopped by to see her new hairstyle and to give her a gift -- a collection of goodies including a hat, some Healing Garden bath lotions and sprays, a flower pen I made, and a card reminding her that like me, she will survive the madness of breast cancer treatment and will go on to enjoy a full head of hair again. And while our travels will be similar in some ways, they are also very different.&nbsp; You see, Gayle had a mastectomy and I did not. So I can\\'t relate to the emotion that comes from losing a breast and feeling lopsided and searching for a bathing suit to mask the unevenness and waiting for reconstruction that won\\'t take place until after chemotherapy is complete. But Gayle is one strong woman and while I know she will have dark moments at times, her attitude and spirit is remarkable. I went to visit her thinking I could spread some hope her way and I walked away with a dose of hope from her -- a woman new to this journey yet full of courage and strength and bravery.Gayle, 33 years old, a wife, and mom of two small boys, told me she will go to work tomorrow with a bald head -- she is not interested in cover-ups -- and this makes her an exceptional person in my book. I never did bare my baldness to the world and kept it covered until my new hair was growing back. I admire Gayle -- and all the women who display their heads like badges of honor -- because she is a true survivor. And one who just might teach me a thing or two. Comments: 1.

I just don't find much time to do it -- with two kids, two jobs, an unpredictable exercise schedule, endless medical appointments, and all the other craziness that accompanies life. I would like to find more time for books -- books a bit more complex than the one I found time to read at bedtime tonight about a frog and a toad who spend their days flying kites and enjoying picnics together. I would like to read books that capture relationships and life experiences and a bit of mystery too.The last book I read -- The Shop on Blossom Street -- is the kind of book I like. It is easy to read and captivating and inspiring and comforting. It is the kind of book I want to keep reading -- long after I have to put it down to tend to distractions. Perhaps it's the thread of cancer woven into the storyline of this book that kept me wanting more.The Shop on Blossom Street -- by Debbie Macomber -- follows four women who are all seeking change in their lives. The lead character opens a yarn shop, years after a cancer diagnosis and with the intention of moving forward despite an uncertain future. She hosts knitting classes and forms relationships with three other women in search of brighter days. Character Lydia Hoffman -- the cancer survivor -- overcomes obstacles and challenges and even another cancer scare. She finds friendship and love and all sorts of unexpected discoveries. She even graces the pages of a second book -- A Good Yarn -- that follows her continued life journeys. I have the book A Good Yarn. It's on my bookshelf. And I can't wait to read it.

       " \"I never thought the time would come when I could fill a page with names of people I know who have cancer or have died from cancer. When my mom's very best friend died years and years ago of pancreatic cancer, it seemed a remote chance that something like that would happen to someone I know. And then slowly, either because cancer cases increased or because my awareness increased -- or both -- my list of people with cancer grew and grew and grew. And now it's quite long. And it's quite disturbing. And it's empowering too -- because most people on my growing list are surviving. And here are seven survivors who are somehow connected to me -- seven survivors who make up just the tip of the cancer iceberg in my life that stretches far and wide.   Mary was one of the first cancer survivors I met just after my own cancer   diagnosis. Mary is a young woman, a wife, a mom of two young children -- and   she is currently thriving with a head full of new hair after a leukemia   diagnosis and subsequent bone marrow transplant.   Julie is a friend from many years ago. We met when my five-year-old Joey   was just a baby and we had no idea cancer would affect us both. But it did.   And just last year, Julie was diagnosed with kidney cancer. She had her right   kidney removed and is fully recovered. She now spends her days managing the   routine of her family -- which includes a husband, three young children, a   dog, and a job too.   Amy and I have never met -- but we've e-mailed and talked on the phone and   cried together about our similar breast cancer diagnoses and treatments. Amy   has survived a mastectomy, reconstruction, and chemotherapy and is now caring   for her mom who has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. Amy is a   nurse, a wife, and a mom of a young son and toddler daughter. Amy is a special   faraway friend.   Pat is a neighbor -- who came knocking on my door when I was sick from   chemotherapy and could barely stand up to answer the door. Yet I found a way   to greet the neighbor I had never before met -- and I found out that she had   just been diagnosed with breast cancer. She was scared and teary and wanted to   talk after a mutual friend led her my way. We spoke and stayed in touch and   just recently modeled together in a cancer-charity fashion show. Pat is also a   nurse, a wife, a mother, and a grandmother.   Gayle is another neighbor who is proudly baring her bald head for all to   see as she receives treatment for breast cancer. Gayle, a wife and mom of two   young boys, works full-time and never seems to waver from her usual spunky   self -- even though she is knee-deep in chemotherapy.   Theresa is co-worker who just recently shared with me that she has   survived thyroid cancer for 12 years. And she has been surviving for two years   the death of her husband from pancreatic cancer. He survived for 15 months   after a prognosis that gave him 12 weeks to live.   Kyle is the son of family friends. I knew him when he was just a baby but   never knew him as he grew into a man. He is now in his 20s and is a college   student, studying to become a pharmacist. Kyle was diagnosed with lymphoma   this year and has completed his course of aggressive treatment. He is back at   school -- and back to life. I could have never predicted it -- that I would know so many people whose lives would be derailed by cancer and whose strength and spirit would allow them to fight to survive. I am sad that these seven people are just a small sample of a much larger cancer picture. But I am proud to be among this group of seven survivors. Because they help me survive. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'On Friday, I was full of anxiety and panic and worry -- all over a lump I feel in my left breast that my oncologist says is probably just scar tissue from my lumpectomy two years ago. I don\\'t like the word probably and the more I thought about it, the more unsettled I became. Too many young women hear that the suspicious bumps and lumps they detect in their breasts are nothing to worry about -- and too many women go on to later discover that these same bumps and lumps are in fact cancer. Sometimes it\\'s in enough time to treat the cancer -- and sometimes it\\'s too late. I am a young woman -- 36 years old -- and I have already had breast cancer. I do not wish to obsess for my entire life about cancer but when I feel a lump in my breast, I want to know it is definitely nothing to worry about. Or I want to know that it is definitely something to worry about -- so I can treat it early.So when I first got a mammogram and ultrasound appointment scheduled for a week from Friday, I accepted it and wrote it down in my calendar. And then panic set in. I realized I could not wait one week and that I should be able to demand a quicker response. So I called my doctor\\'s office, spoke to the receptionist through uncontrollable tears, and somehow ended up with the doctor herself on the phone. \"What\\'s wrong?\" she said. \"I\\'m freaking out,\" I told her. \"What do you want to do?\" she asked. \"Do you want to come in right now?\" She told me she had a busy day, had a biopsy to perform that would take a while, but that I could come hang out in her office until she could get to me. Or I could come in on Monday, she said. I let myself calm down a bit and told her Monday would be good. She asked me what time I wanted to come -- she offered me any time that fit my schedule. I chose 9:00 AM. So tomorrow morning, I will find out what exactly sits underneath the skin on my left breast, near my armpit -- what exactly it is that feels to me like a little mound of tissue that just doesn\\'t seem right. Maybe it\\'s scar tissue -- and I hope it is -- and maybe it\\'s something else. I can only hope that at the end of my appointment I look foolish for pursuing something that doesn\\'t deserve the attention I\\'m giving it. But if it does deserve attention, I will know I\\'ve done the right thing by vigorously pursuing an appointment I just couldn\\'t wait one week for. Comments: ',\n",

These scholarships help universities compete for the best and brightest students. And the beneficiaries of these scholarships are many. Universities get what they want -- good students. Students get what they want -- funding for college. And the community gets something too.

       " \"My mammogram and ultrasound today revealed nothing but normal, healthy tissue. The doctor said my pictures looked beautiful -- and she could find not one thing to worry about. She really looked for something -- because I was convinced there was something wrong when I found a lump-like bump in my left breast two weeks ago. So convinced that I was riddled with anxiety and panic and fear. But now I am happy and content once again -- and relieved that my fears were unfounded.The explanation my doctor offered for the lumpiness I detected goes like this: my breast has been swollen and plump ever since my lumpectomy and radiation over the course of almost two years. Slowly, the swelling is disappearing and so all the tissue hidden under the plumpness is coming to the surface. It's always been there -- she could see it when she looked at my previous mammograms -- but I haven't noticed. Now, it's become more apparent as my breast returns to its normal size and shape. And so it seemed new to me. And suspicious. And wrong. But it's okay. It's normal. It's nothing to worry about.And so I am not worried. I am settled and calm and thrilled to be surviving breast cancer, without fear that the disease is coming back. At least for today. Comments: 1.

She has breast cancer, has just finished her final chemotherapy treatment, and proudly displays her bald head as she enthusiastically takes on life. I introduced her to my husband, we all chatted, and then we parted ways. And soon after, my husband asked me if she is the neighbor whose husband we spoke with just recently about his wife's breast cancer journey. I told him this was a different woman -- another neighbor with breast cancer. Including me, that makes three of us with breast cancer in the same community of just 200 houses. And this shocked my husband -- that there are three of us in the same neighborhood with breast cancer. But I told him this really is not surprising, that it's probably not all that uncommon. And I told him there are probably more women with breast cancer residing in the houses on the streets that surround us. We just don't know them all.I've heard many times that most people are personally touched by breast cancer in some way. It might be each of us with the diagnosis. Or it may be a family member. Or a friend. Or a co-worker. Or a neighbor. Because incidences of breast cancer have increased over the years, and in the United States, the rate of new cases has been increasing more than one percent per year since the 1940s. In the 1980s, the rate of new cases rose markedly -- perhaps due to increased and better screening -- and only recently have cases been leveling off. It is estimated that just over 200,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in American women in 2006. One in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in her life. And that is startling. Which is why it is not so startling to me that there are three of us in my neighborhood with this common disease -- the second-leading cause of cancer death for women, after lung cancer. Comments: 1.

In October 2005, in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Couric broadcast her own mammogram on the Today Show in hopes of motivating women everywhere to get schedule their own mammograms.

       " 'Recent research indicates that obesity makes ovarian cancer deadlier and more likely to recur. According to physician and senior author of the study, Dr. Andrew J. Li of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, maintaining ideal body weight is important for many reasons. This is just one more reason to reduce obesity -- because obese women suffering from advanced ovarian cancer are more likely to die than women at healthy weights. They also suffer recurrences more quickly. On average, women in the study considered overweight or obese saw an average of 16 months before recurrence while those considered underweight or at a healthy weight saw 25 months.Perhaps it\\'s the secretion of adipose tissue that makes tumors less sensitive to chemotherapy. Li said there are ideas on the table -- and his team are looking into them. One fact they feel certain about is that obesity does not increase the chances of contracting ovarian cancer. It just shows the odds of survival are diminished once the disease has been contracted.

       " \"A chemical found in hard plastics -- such as CD cases, baby bottles, food-storage containers, and even electronics parts -- has been loosely linked to incidences of breast cancer. Popular opinion cautions that if we were not worried about this news yesterday, we should not be worried about it today -- because studies are preliminary and nothing is definitive at this point. But there are definitely two sides to the debate over how harmful these hard plastics may be.The chemical in question -- a pseudo-estrogen called bisphenol-A (BPA) -- appears to be absorbed by breast tumor cells, according to a new study published in the August 28 issue of Chemistry &amp; Biology. Previous studies have linked small exposures of BPA to prostate abnormalities in mice that suggest a link between the plastic chemical and human prostate cancer. Some studies even theorize that embryonic and fetal exposure might influence mental retardation and birth defects. And because this pseudo-estrogen is a synthetic material that in human cells can trigger estrogenic effects, breast cancer now comes up as a disease that may result from this questionable chemical.Critics say that average levels of the chemical found in urine is infinitesimally small -- about one part per billion. Some say the results of this research come from in-vitro studies that one expert says can never fully explain human disease. Yet the real crux of the matter, according to another expert, is that we are surrounded by all sorts of chemicals that are pseudo-estrogenic -- not just BPA -- and it's the cumulative effects that we do need to worry about.

Because I eat most everything in moderation, I have felt that anything I am ingesting is too small an amount to make any real difference. I have heard recommendations about nixing preserved foods and anything treated with hormones and refined sugar and while I try to eat a balanced, healthy diet -- with a bit of sweet stuff thrown in -- I do sometimes indulge my cravings for foods that are not very healthy. Like chips -- which writer Robert L. Wolke says he is definitely eliminating from his diet.The chemical acrylamide -- a probable carcinogen -- has been found in fried starchy foods, especially potato chips and French fries. This chemical is not a contaminant that somehow appears in our food but is created by chemical reactions that take place during cooking at high temperatures. It's a chemical that has been used in industry and has been known to damage the central nervous system, the immune system, and the reproductive system. And it may cause cancer. Recently, acrylamide was discovered in foods at hundreds of times the .5-parts-per-billion level that is considered safe in drinking water.Authorities in Germany have already begun enforcing regulations to minimize the amounts of acrylamide in foods. But the United States has been criticized for dragging its feet on this issue. In fact, the National Uniformity for Food Act (H.R. 4167) recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives, with 94 percent of Republicans supporting it and 64 percent of Democrats opposing. It has gone to the Senate, where it was the subject of a hearing on July 27. The act would prohibit states or local governments from setting more stringent limits on toxic substances. Each of us can still take personal action with regard to the foods we eat -- despite what the government dictates. We can decide what to eat and what not to eat. In the interest of our health.

The title of the e-mail that entered my in-box read I miss you. It was from my friend Amy in Ohio. Amy and I have never met, have only e-mailed and spoken on the phone, and are fortunate to have found each other as a result of a mutual friend -- Ericha -- who connected us because of our similar breast cancer journeys. Amy and I are both in our 30s, both have a husband and two young children, and both were diagnosed with cancer that had not spread to our lymph nodes. We felt lucky. But the news that Amy shared with me today is not so lucky.Jacki,I\\'m sorry it\\'s been so long. I don\\'t know if Ericha filled you in on me -- my cancer is back. I have brain and lung mets. I found out about 2 weeks ago. I am receiving brain radiation and a new chemo. The doc says depending how I do I have 2-12 months. I \\'ll write more later. Love, AmyAnd so that is all I know. And it\\'s really all I need to know. It\\'s enough to know that cancer is unpredictable -- despite the statistics that indicated we both had pretty high odds of surviving. It\\'s enough to shatter my hopeful spirit. It\\'s enough to make me wonder if this will happen to me. It\\'s enough to make me truly sad.Yet in the midst of this news, I will hang on to one thought -- Miracles happen every day. Comments: 1. Jacki,I am not giving up. I will beat this again.

       " \"It's a question that could face any one of us at any time -- the question over whether to pay the high cost of cancer treatment, when it could send us into debt, or to discontinue treatment in order to save money for the family members who will survive us. Dying of lung cancer, Carolyn Hobbs was confronted with this exact question when considering a new biotechnology drug -- Erbitux -- that she learned cost $1,800. The drug may have extended her life but she determined it wasn't worth it -- and she refused the treatment.During the last decade, expensive new treatments -- some upwards of $50,000 -- have given some patients their first real fighting chance against disease. The problem with these treatments, however, is that most patients will only survive an extra few months. A lucky few may survive for years. For some, maybe the small fortune these few months or years cost is worth it. For others, squandering their life savings on an extended death sentence is not worth it. For me -- right now -- I believe I would do anything possible to ensure a longer life. And according to one poll, nearly one-third of Americans faced with death would also do anything possible to survive just a bit longer. This percentage is up from one-fifth in 1990. So I have some company in my corner. But I have not walked in the shoes that require this type of decision. I can only speculate about how I might approach this life-and-death decision. And hopefully, I will never have to make it. Comments: 1. I think it unfortunate that American Health care has it's citizens weighing life against debt.\",\n",
       " \"On August 9, Patty was diagnosed with breast cancer. She is 36 years old, a wife, a mother of four children -- and already a fighter in her battle that has just begun. So far, she has endured surgery, and she will soon proceed through months of intensive chemotherapy, one year of Herceptin treatment, and weeks and weeks of radiation. It's a familiar path for so many women -- a path marked by devastation, fear, worry, and panic. Yet if there is a gift that flows from cancer, it must be the support and concern and love that can cushion the blow delivered by this disease.Patty has an abundance of support -- and it all starts with her husband, ironically an administrator of two cancer centers, who is blogging her journey with great strength and an overwhelming love for his wife whose own mother died of breast cancer in 1992 at the age of 46. Patty and her husband have been vigilant about monitoring her health over the years -- in light of her family history -- and Patty had been tested, screened, biopsied, and examined many times before her diagnosis. When her recent tests and biopsies revealed breast cancer, it was both shocking and expected.Now Patty and her husband -- who authors the blog Patty's Journey -- are expecting the best of outcomes on this journey of a lifetime. Comments: 1. I am so glad this had made the Cancer blog. Way to go. Now you will have even more supporters and you certainly need that and prayers.

       " \"When we memorialize someone at the time of death, we often refer to the date of birth and the date of death. These numbers tell us something -- like the age of the person -- but they don't say much about the life that fills the gap between start date and end date. They don't tell of the life that was surely full of ups and downs and victories and struggles. And happiness and joy and sadness and sorrow. And family and friends and jobs and hobbies. They don't do justice to the true stuff of life that is so much more important than numbers. But there is something important about these two sets of numbers -- something that when really examined, tells the full story. This important something -- the dash.The dash that separates these static numbers is what tells the story of life. So consider your own dash when contemplating life, while determining how to spend your time and fill your days. Make your dash matter. Make it worthwhile. Make it something that people will talk about long after your own numbers become a matter of permanent record. And when you memorialize loved ones in the future, think about what their dashes mean. Talk about them, remember them, honor them. And pass on this link -- http://www.thedashmovie.com/ -- so others will consider the meaning that flows from each simple dash. Comments: \",\n",

Somehow, Amy is approaching this ordeal with spunk and grace -- while I feel a bit deflated. Somehow, Amy is teaching me that attitude is everything. That there is still hope.

She taught us so much during her \"fight\" with cancer. Unfortunately she lost her battle but she NEVER gave up the fight. My sister and I have since started a company to help inspire and encourage those who are in a daily battle. It was actually our mother\\'s idea. I took her a pair of boxing gloves when she started her chemo treatments. She had liposarcoma (soft tissue). I took her a pair of boxing gloves with hand-written messages on the gloves from her family and friends.

       " 'I have made on-line visits to Wikipedia many times -- mostly for information on cancer. And what I\\'ve found are endless resources, thoroughly-covered topics, and material that is easy to read and easy to understand. Wikipedia, a free on-line encyclopedia -- where readers can participate in editing and changing content -- offers information on just about any topic you can imagine. And here are seven stops you might make in pursuit of cancer-related material.   Health is the ability of   our bodies to effectively respond to challenges and stressors in our world and   to effectively restore and maintain a state of balance. Sickness is simply the   absence of health. There are all sorts of components of health -- and many of   them, including exercise, hygiene, nutrition, and mental health can be found   on this site.   Cancer is the   uncontrollable division of cells which includes the scary possibility of cell   division, resulting in a possible spread of the disease. The history of cancer   is addressed in this area as well as classifications of cancer, causes,   epidemiology, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, coping, and research -- all in   a basic yet detailed manner.   Conventional   medicine is the branch of medicine concerned with diagnosis and treatment   of disease and injury. Here you will learn about the history of medicine, the   practice of medicine, branches of medicine, medical education, and legal   restrictions. And if this approach to healing does not convince you, consider   visiting the alternative medicine area.   Alternative   medicine includes spiritual, metaphysical, and religious foundations of   healing, and not conventional medicine -- although there is a balance between   the two, called complementary medicine, which aims to blend the two   approaches. This is where you\\'ll find information on the regulation and safety   of alternative medicine and support and criticism of this type of   healing.   Chemotherapy is   the use of chemicals to treat disease. Types of chemotherapy, doses, delivery   methods, treatments plans, side effects, and principles of chemotherapy are   all presented here.   Radiation   therapy is the use of ionizing radiation for the control of malignant   cells. Radiation can be used on its own or in conjunction with other   treatment, such as chemotherapy. Sometimes, radiation is used for palliative   care -- when a cure is not possible but relief is. Discover here how radiation   works and what common side effects exist. Find out about dosages and about the   many different types of radiation that are currently is use.   In a support   group, members provide each other with help for a shared burdensome   characteristic -- like cancer. Members of support groups typically share   relevant information, talk about personal experiences, listen to each other,   and share empathy. There are self-help support groups, professionally-run   support groups, and on-line support groups. And each is outlined on the   on-line pages of Wikipedia. Wikipedia is deep with information. And these are just seven topics that can be researched through this valuable tool. Comments: 1. There is so much great medical information available to the individual now with the advent of the internet.Part of the problem now is how to separate the wheat from the chaff and not get too bogged down or overwhelmed.I\\'ve created a new multimedia product to help people quickly and efficiently research cancer and cancer treatment the way a doctor would if he or she had cancer. The product can be found at my website <A href=\"http://www.researchyourcancer.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.researchyourcancer.com/</A>2. Thanks for the given information!',\n",

Like a hand on my shoulder, a note in the mail, a phone call to see how I'm doing -- and a happy boobie card my friend and fitness trainer gave me the other day. I went to her house for a training session, and she greeted me at the door with a purple piece of paper cut into the shape of breasts. Butterfly stickers marked the nipple areas and the words Good Luck, Jacki were written happily in red marker. Just the day before I received this cheery gift, we had spoken about my upcoming mammogram and ultrasound for a suspicious lump I had discovered in my breast. We have spoken about my whole cancer journey over the course of my whole training journey -- so she knows all about the ups and downs. And when she sensed my dip in spirits, she reached out, with love and concern -- and with happy boobies.My mammogram and ultrasound turned out just fine. Nothing is wrong. What I felt is just normal tissue. My cancer is not back.

I have tried actual diaper bags and purses I transformed into diaper bags and tote bags -- you name it, I've tried it. And then one day, I figured out the ideal solution -- a backpack. Not a school backpack but a purse that is carried like a backpack. It doesn't weigh me down on one side, it keeps my arms free for mommy tasks -- like controlling flailing babies and toddlers -- and it ties up tightly so little fingers cannot quickly grab and poke and shovel through my things. It's just right -- for me, anyway.As my kids get older, my stock of gear gets smaller and smaller. And I am now down to carrying diaper wipes and diapers.

The content on this site is powerful, edgy, and truly inspiring -- it incites public action. And it makes me want to jump up and do something -- now. To break down the barriers to progress in pursuit of the causes and cures for breast cancer -- which is the whole purpose of Hurricane Voices.Hurricane Voices began because of one woman -- Lois Egasti, a wife and mother living with metastatic breast cancer. Lois, who passed away on April 15, 2003, knew she was not alone and felt the need to take a stand against the disease. So she put her urge into action and formed this not-for-profit organization. And in just four years, a great community of voices emerged -- voices that have helped raise support and participation in far-reaching programs and events.Hurricane Voices offers on its website a family reading list, a regular newsletter, an empowering overview of breast cancer and its statistics, and a sampling of various myths surrounding breast cancer. Hurricane Voices provides direction for involvement in unique conferences -- such as When a Parent Has Cancer: Strengthening the School's Response which helps school systems support families affected by parental cancer and Breast Cancer: Truth &amp; Consequences, a conference that challenges the status quo concerning breast cancer. Hurricane Voices initiates thought-provoking public awareness campaigns and strives to inform the public that the disease we call breast cancer is a very serious illness. Every day, more people are being diagnosed. Every day, more people are dying. Yet we are not beating this disease -- in fact in the time it takes to brush our teeth or drink a cup of coffee, another person has died of breast cancer. And this is what Hurricane Voices wants us to know. This and the fact that well-meaning, misconstrued survival rates in the 90 percentiles only extend for five years. And five years is just not enough.Powerful -- that's what Hurricane Voices is -- powerful. And each of us can contribute our own power to this organization by becoming a Hurricane Voice.

       " \"At this time, there are 200 companies engaged in 600 clinical trials that involve 340 immunotherapy drugs -- all under study in an attempt to assist in the treatment of 40 different cancers. The top five targeted cancers are melanoma, breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal.While antibody studies are the top headline-makers right now, cancer vaccines are following behind. With the recent approval of Gardasil -- the cervical cancer vaccine -- the push for more vaccine options will become strong. Future industry challenges also include discovering strong antigens, effective immunomodulators, and suitable delivery technologies. Powerful drugs like Avastin, Erbitux, and Rituxan are just the precursors to what might lie ahead for cancer patients as a result of this widespread effort to knock cancer out of the ballpark. Comments: 1. Let's talk about it?2. Tumor immunotherapy studies were prematurely abandoned during the early 90's. One such study was a concept of in situ cancer vaccination based upon studies of biologic response modifiers in an assay. Preliminary results found a striking association between the activity of biologic response modifiers which activate macrophages and the prior treatment status of patients with breast and ovarian cancers. Effective chemotherapy produced a massive release and processing of tumor antigens, which led to a state in which the human immune system, via in situ cancer vaccination, responded to exogenous macrophage activation signals with potent and specific anti-tumor effects.I'm also glad to see the resurgence of aggressive cancer vaccine research. Criticism of this research would be typical of those that favor attempts to identify one-size-fits-all treatments through trial-and-error testing. Circumscription of the clinical initiative by researchers to help patients advances a naive fundamentalism. The choice of researchers to integrate promising insights and methods remains an essential component of new paradigms of cancer treatment.\",\n",
       " 'Heartburn has never really been considered a major health concern. It has been considered uncomfortable and annoying and troublesome -- yet still only a harmless nuisance. In recent studies, though -- summed up in the September 2006 Oprah magazine -- heartburn has been linked to a deadly form of esophageal cancer. Apparently, people who experience heartburn one time per week or more have a fivefold or greater risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus -- a cancer with incidences jumping as much as 500 percent over the past 40 years. Experts insist, however, that adenocarcinoma is still rare. One doctor states that 40 percent of Americans have heartburn once per month -- yet only 8,000 to 9,000 people develop this specific cancer each year.For the unfortunate few who do go on to contract cancer, there is hope in a surgical procedure to remove the cancer and part or all of the esophagus and nearby lymph nodes -- which can dramatically increase the odds for survival. For most of us, a bit of heartburn does not signal an eventual cancer diagnosis. It just means we might need to self-treat the symptoms with over-the-counter remedies. And a recent review at Stanford suggests that sleeping with your head elevated can reduce reflux pain.You should see a doctor if your heartburn results in a consistent burning sensation, difficulty swallowing, or vomiting.

       " 'Researchers from the National Cancer Institute announced Thursday that two cancer patients with rapidly growing melanoma were successfully treated with gene therapy. The patients -- both men -- were given immune system cells from their own blood that were engineered to attack their tumors. This took place 18 months ago -- and they are still surviving with no evidence of cancer. This success comes after a three-decade effort by surgeon Steven Rosenberg to find ways to use the immune system to fight cancer. This approach is not always successful, however, and 15 other patients who got this same treatment did not survive. Still, Rosenberg believes this small-scale success is proof that the principle of gene therapy can work. And others agree -- calling his work an important landmark, even though the response rate of two out of 17 is not ideal.Rosenberg does not claim the two surviving patients are cured. If they survive for five years, he might classify them as possibly cured -- but even after five years, cancer can come back. He does consider this a huge breakthrough for these two men who are still alive and well. And he says he has every expectation that he can get the process to work even better in the future.

       " \"Chloe is a little girl conceived through in vitro fertilization -- not because her parents could not conceive in the traditional manner but because they wanted to make sure Chloe had no predisposition to cancer in her genetic makeup. And in vitro fertilization is one method of almost ensuring this. There is still a three percent chance of failure but Chloe's parents felt confident in the elective process that would mostly prevent her from inheriting a genetic mutation for colon cancer that has devastated her family -- Chloe's father carries this mutation, and his mother, grandfather, and two uncles have all died from colon cancer.A growing number of couples are using preimplantation genetic makeup to detect a predisposition to cancers that may or may not develop later in life. Using this procedure, parents subject their tiny embryos to genetic tests to determine whether or not they harbor defective genes. Essentially, parents get to pick and choose from embryos in a petri dish which one they want. Since the embryo that became Chloe did not test positive for any defective genes, she was the chosen one. And she is now a healthy two-year-old girl.It's an ethical minefield -- this scientific creation of human life and the picking and choosing of which embryos will survive and which ones will not. One expert says the issue centers around what is considered serious enough to warrant such testing -- and who gets to make this decision. Ethical dilemmas surrounding this issue will only continue to grow as more and more options become available. Already embryos are tested for predisposition for obesity and deafness and a mild skin condition. Some clinics even screen for gender. Some fear this practice may lead to a genetic class divide where the wealthy will become more genetically pure than the poor -- because this process is difficult and expensive, costing tens of thousands of dollars without insurance coverage.Chloe's parents are happy they made the choice they did. Her father says he doesn't know if he could handle being told his daughter has cancer -- especially with the knowledge that he could have prevented it. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'Most current media reports have us believing that incidences of cancer are at epidemic proportions. What isn\\'t making headlines is the fact that for many cancers, incidences of the disease are on the decline. This is what the American Council on Science and Health states as a result of a new report released from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, the American Cancer Society, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If only reports like this were splashed all over our newspapers and television screens -- instead of grim reports of increasing diagnoses and deaths -- then maybe the outlook on cancer would be a bit more hopeful.Rates of colorectal cancer, uterine cancer, stomach cancer, and cervical cancer have all been declining for two years. Drops in cases are mostly attributed to lower rates of smoking, better screening, and better treatments. For men, lung cancer death rates have also fallen. So not all incidences of all cancers have dropped -- but some have. And this should at least keep us hoping, dreaming, wishing for a day when cancer is not even loosely associated with the word epidemic. And it should surely be cause for at least some media coverage. Comments: 1. Many thanks for the interesting information. 2. Careful here. You are confusing death rate and incidence.From the ACS web, \"A new report from the nationâ\\x80\\x99s leading cancer organizations finds that Americansâ\\x80\\x99 risk of dying from cancer continues to drop, maintaining a trend that began in the early 1990s. However, the rate of new cancers remains stable. \"Improvement in the death rate is due mostly, but not completely, to better treatment. For the environmental activists, however, incidence is the key number. Aside from this, the report is a good example of the US health bureaucrats\\' obsession with race. The greater part of this report is about differences between \"latinos\" and other \"races\". The definition of races has reached a surprising degree of sophistication: \"The indirect component is a hierarchical algorithm of ethnicity assignment based on race, birthplace, gender, maiden name, and surname.\" Why they spend so much time and effort to color people is beyond me.EM, in CanadaFor the record, here is the link to the whole report:<A href=\"http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/112777119/HTMLSTART\" rel=nofollow>http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/112777119/HTMLSTART</A>3. \"Aside from this, the report is a good example of the US health bureaucrats\\' obsession with race.\" Could you explain further?\"The greater part of this report is about differences between \"latinos\" and other \"races\".\" No, it wasn\\'t. There was one special section on that subject.\"The definition of races has reached a surprising degree of sophistication: \"The indirect component is a hierarchical algorithm of ethnicity assignment based on race, birthplace, gender, maiden name, and surname.\" Why they spend so much time and effort to color people is beyond me.\"To color people? How else do we get information that can help us determine cancer epidemiology: behavior vs. genes; effects of socioeconomic status, incidence, and access to treatment; gender comparisons? Maybe it\\'s too much information for some, but we pay good people to help us determine cancer cause and incidence.For a better look:<A href=\"http://www.seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Health/6-09-07-CancerDeathRisk.htm\" rel=nofollow>http://www.seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Health/6-09-07-CancerDeathRisk.htm</A>4. I was asked to explain why I think the US health bureaucrats are obsessed with race. With pleasure. Below are links to recent cancer statistics from the Canadian Cancer Society, the European UICC and the Australian Cancer Council. You will notice the complete absence of race from these statistics. As far as I know, the US is the only first-world country that publishes cancer statistics based on race.The message, from me and the rest of the world, is this: if you want to look at socio-economics, ask about money. If you want to look at genes, test the DNA. And so on.The concept of race is scientifically baseless. Among those called \"latinos\" by their hierarchical algorithm, some have a pure European (\"white\") ancestry, some are pure amerindians, most are mixed. Even these ancestral groups are genetically diverse and colorful. Therefore, the premise that race is a substitute for genes is flawed.Unless, of course, you prefer to believe that it is the rest of the world that is flawed.EM, in Canada<A href=\"http://cancer.ca/vgn/images/portal/cit_86751114/31/21/935505792cw_2006stats_en.pdf.pdf\" rel=nofollow>http://cancer.ca/vgn/images/portal/cit_86751114/31/21/935505792cw_2006stats_en.pdf.pdf</A><A href=\"http://www.uicc.org/fileadmin/manual/5burden.pdf\" rel=nofollow>http://www.uicc.org/fileadmin/manual/5burden.pdf</A><A href=\"http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/can/ca01/ca01.pdf\" rel=nofollow>http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/can/ca01/ca01.pdf</A>5. \"The concept of race is scientifically baseless.\"Whoa!

Adequate levels of Vitamin D seem to have a protective effect against cancer. Since Vitamin D production is somewhat inhibited through higher levels of melanin, black men living in equatorial areas of limited sunlight (such as in the north) may not produce sufficient Vitamin D._I say we study it. Unless, of course, you\\'re sure it\\'s baseless.Or:A comparative analysis of breast cancer risk factors among African-American women and white women indicated that racial variations in both prevalences of and risks associated with particular factors may contribute to the higher incidence of breast cancer among younger African-American women.<A href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=15615914&amp;dopt=Abstract\" rel=nofollow>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=15615914&amp;dopt=Abstract</A>Of couse, if you don\\'t want to study it, that\\'s OK.Somebody else will and perhaps we\\'ll benefit.Here\\'s another6. The story about the relationship between melanin and PSA was a nice find, I did not know this. Now, East Indians and Australian arborigenes are as dark as Africans. How is their PSA level? My point: if you want to look at melanin, use the skin phototype scale (ask your dermatologist).As for the study about breast cancer, I\\'ll repeat myself: if you want to look at genes, test DNA. If you want to look at diet, fill a food diary. And so on.In every study, except perhaps a study on racism, race is used as a surrogate for something else. If this something else was measured directly, the results would be better. Therefore, race-based science is bad science. One simple question: why is the US the only first-world country that compiles cancer statistics by race? Please answer.EM, in CanadaPS: for the sake of disclosure, my race is half-white, half-middle-eastern. However, since the white half comes from Spain, including my surname, I would probably be classified by the NCI\\'s hierarchical algorithm as latino. Michelle, what is your race?',\n",
       " \"I was in the emergency room the other night with my three-year-old who was experiencing a mysterious leg pain that resulted from a bad case of strep throat. It wasn't serious enough to warrant swift movement from the waiting room to an actual room and we sat in a holding pattern with a crowd of other patients, some of whom were still waiting after Danny had been treated and released. I was told patients are served in the order in which they arrive but also according to the seriousness of their complaints -- which takes me back to the night I was in the ER with a fever, headache, sore throat, and sore gums. The night I was given a mask and was immediately escorted from the waiting room to a private room where doctors and nurses treated me for neutropenia -- a condition caused by chemotherapy and marked by a drop in neutrophil levels, a condition that puts chemotherapy patients at great risk for infection. This was the second time I went to the hospital for neutropenia. Both times I was admitted and treated for five days.And so sitting in the ER reminded me about how serious chemotherapy side effects can be. And it makes me want to caution all chemotherapy patients to never dismiss the signs that the body is suffering -- to never tough it out with the hope that a good night's sleep or a few days rest will straighten everything out. Because it may not -- and the end result may be tragic.All chemotherapy patients should be briefed by their medical teams about when to call for medical assistance. For me, a temperature of 100.4 was the magic call-for-help signal. And twice, I called for help -- once in the middle of the night. But any symptoms , and definitely a combination of symptoms, are cause enough for a simple phone call. So don't delay. Don't excuse warning signs that your body is struggling. Don't second-guess your decision to notify a medical professional about your symptoms. Just call. It could save your life. Comments: 1. I can't believe the FDA still approves the poison they call chemotherapy. The medicine makes the patient sicker than the cancer. It's all about the money that chemotherapy brings to the pharmaceutical companies. These companies spend big money on lobbyists to protect their financial interests. They don't care if they kill or maim people in the process. Until the American Cancer Society and Race for the Cure put money into finding a more humane treatment for cancer, I will not support the legalized poisoning of people who have cancer.\",\n",
       " 'A few years ago -- I can\\'t remember exactly when -- I cut bunches of red wavy locks from my friend\\'s head. I tied Amber\\'s thick hair into one big ponytail, and I cut away. It was an extreme haircut for sure. Amber\\'s long hairstyle was transformed into a shoulder-length bob, and for good reason.Amber sent her 10-inch ponytail to Locks of Love, a non-profit organization that creates human hair wigs and hairpieces from donated hair and gives them to children under the age of 18 who have lost their hair due a medical condition. This was the first time I\\'d heard of Locks of Love, and I\\'ve since met many others who have purposely grown their hair in order to donate it. I have a neighbor who has done it three or four times now. I know two teenage brothers who have cut their long, dark hair for this great cause. And I\\'ve known toddlers whose parents have waited for that first haircut until 10 inches could be cut.Ten inches is the magic number. Once tied into a ponytail, there must be 10 inches of hair hanging beneath the rubber band. The ponytail is cut off and what remains can be cut into a new style. Locks of Love provides the procedures for mailing the hair, and the details can be found on the Locks of Love website.I was bald this time last year -- after receiving four rounds of toxic chemotherapy for breast cancer -- and I know how devastating hair loss can be. It affected my self-esteem, and I can only imagine how it affects children whose self-esteem is just forming. You might consider donating your hair so that a child\\'s confidence can be restored during a time that is so difficult and challenging. I will consider it too -- but I must say that for now, I am enjoying watching my new short, brown, curly hair grow and grow and grow. Comments: 1. It should be made very clear that Locks of Love does NOT donate wigs to kids being treated for cancer. rather, their focus is on people with a condition known as Alopecia. further, LOL has produced only about a hundred wigs a year while it has received about 10,00 hair donations per month!2. Hi All!Locks of Love is a great hair donation program for children suffering from hair loss. Recently I came across another great hair donation program called Pantene Beautiful Lengths. This charity initiative is encouraging people to grow, cut and donate their hair to women who have lost their hair due to cancer treatment. This program has made hair donation really easy -- Check out the program\\'s website at beautifullengths.com for more information. This is a great charity promotion for a really great cause!! 3. i\\'ve heard negative things about locks of love from several folks, but i have 12-18\" of my hair that i\\'m ready to cut &amp; donate. i\\'m leaning toward wigsforkids.org, any scoop i should know about them? or if anyone knows of a grassroots organization in the san francisco bay area for hair donations, even better...thanks.',\n",
       " 'I really do believe deep down in my gut that I will survive breast cancer -- that I will witness the wonder of my children growing up, that I will be married long enough that the years blur together, that I will live to a ripe old age. But I still have moments of doubt -- moments powerful enough to make me think I should not have a third child, just in case cancer comes back. To combat these moments -- that seem to surface more now that my treatment has stopped -- I try to keep busy, keep my mind occupied, keep living. My steps for surviving in the short-term include writing, journaling, exercising, relaxing, and spending time with family. But I also follow some steps for long-term survival -- steps that transcend the moment and give me purpose and direction. And here are seven of them.   Building relationships with my health care providers   helps me feel like I matter. I don\\'t like feeling like a number, lost in the   system, grasping for someone to notice me. Getting to know those who provide   my medical care is comforting. And when I pick up the phone and call with my   mostly irrational worries, I know the person on the other line knows who I am   and how to help. The surgeon who performed my lumpectomy almost two years ago   saw my sister the other day and immediately asked about me. He is one of those   doctors who says, \"call me if you ever need anything.\" And I know he means it.   And I will call. I do call. It helps me survive.    Advocating for my own health is critical to my survival   -- because my biggest fear is recurrence and if I can\\'t step up and take   action, then no one will. So I don\\'t worry about how silly my questions may be   or how off-the-wall my anxieties are. I pursue whatever is troubling me. It   helps to know that if something I wrong, I will discover it   early.  Identifying positive effects of cancer helps me find   balance in my cancer journey. There are endless negative consequences that   spring from this disease but with the right amount of reframing in my mind, I   can identify endless positive consequences too -- like opportunities for   writing that have come my way and the money I have been able to raise for the   American Cancer Society and my curly brown hair that people tell me looks even   better than the hair that chemo took from me. The list goes on.  Connecting with others from all experiences and journeys   keeps me in good company. And because of cancer, I think I can more deeply   engage with others -- maybe because I can more accurately sense their ups and   downs and can identify with their moments of crisis. Or perhaps it\\'s that I am   not afraid to discuss sensitive topics -- since I have my own sensitive topic.   Cancer has made me open up more, share more, and connect more. And connections   make me feel alive.  Helping others helps me. It shifts my attention from my   own condition and allows me to focus on a greater good. If I can share one ray   of sunshine, one piece of advice, one bit of wisdom with someone who needs it,   then I feel I have helped in some small way. And when I needed it most, help   from others was my best form of medicine.  Setting new life goals keeps my sight on the future.   Prior to cancer, I was not sure what my future had in store for me. But after   cancer -- which threatened to take my future -- I oddly have more clarity and   perspective. I know I want to continue writing and writing and writing, for   myself, for others, for pay. Nothing else competes with this desire that was   far from my mind in my pre-cancer days.  Making a difference gives me a reason to move forward.   Whether through fundraising or volunteering or a blog post on this site that   reaches just one person, making a difference keeps me motivated and inspired   and distracted from the moments that seem dark and dismal. The moments filled   with doubt and panic and hopelessness. The moments I aim to keep to a minimum   as I strive to survive.  Comments: ',\n",
       " \"She says it's all that really matters to her -- the time she spends with family. It comes before work and commitments and responsibilities. It shapes her minutes, her hours, her days. It brings her joy and laughter and sometimes tears. It propels her, comforts her, inspires her. And it shows -- in everything she does. And she does a lot. But most important, especially in light of today -- Grandparent's Day -- is what she does for her grandchildren who are too small to truly express what's in their little hearts but will surely one day shout from rooftops with joy about this woman who wraps them in love every day. But for now, these three children -- ages five, three, and almost two -- mostly just shout happily about all sorts of things that don't always make a lot of sense. So today, I will speak for them. I will say thank you to their Nana -- my mom -- who watches her granddaughter every day, picks up her grandson from kindergarten two times per week, takes all three kids on swimming adventures, babysits on a moment's notice, and has twice this year sat with her daughters for hours in emergency rooms with sick babies. And in addition to the fact that she was completely by my side during my breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, she was also somehow caring for my children -- her grandsons.If my mom wasn't sitting with me during chemotherapy infusions, she was watching my boys so my husband could be with me. If she wasn't sitting with me in the hospital each time I was admitted with neutropenia, she was at home with my boys so my husband could sit with me. And when my husband had to rush me to the hospital with dangerous fevers, she arrived in the middle of the night, slept in my bed, and greeted my babies when they woke. She entertained my boys every day for seven weeks while I hauled myself to and from radiation appointments. During chemo, she took my kids when I was tired, foggy, incoherent and needed desperately to sleep. She did it all -- tirelessly, effortlessly, constantly.And so on this Grandparent's Day, I realize that I owe this grandma for saving my life. By caring for the two most important people in my world, she allowed me to fight for my life -- and to come back to life. And there seems nothing really appropriate I can share with her for this gift she has given me. But I can say thank you. And one day, when they can eloquently express their own feelings, I know Jordan and Joey and Danny will all let their Nana know just how important she is. All day. Every day. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"I am struggling to find healthy lunch items for my kindergartner who has been a picky eater since the day he was first introduced to food. He won't eat a sandwich -- well, he will eat a peanut butter sandwich but for some reason he thinks it must be warmed in a microwave. But microwaves are not available in his school cafeteria, so peanut butter sandwiches won't work -- nor will anything else that must be heated to satisfy Joey's picky palate. And he won't eat lunch meat or cheese or tuna fish or anything that seems to fill most kids' lunch boxes. He does eat fruits and vegetables -- which is primarily what I send him with to school -- but it seems he needs something more. Something with a kick of protein. But I'm stuck. So today I went to the grocery store in search of the magic item that will both satisfy Joey and satisfy even the smallest of nutritional needs. I ended up with yogurt.I have never been a huge fan of yogurt because it's loaded with sugar. But yogurt does contain some vitamins and some calcium and a little bit of protein -- 5 grams -- and I opted for the light, fat-free variety which makes me feel better about my purchase. And tomorrow, my experiment begins. If the yogurt container is missing when I open Joey's lunch box after school, I will assume he has eaten the yogurt. If the container is still in the lunch box -- and is still full of yogurt -- I will start back at square one. And I'll just hope he doesn't figure out that he can toss the whole unopened yogurt container right into the trash. Surely, a five-year-old wouldn't think of that. Okay, yes he would.Even though Joey may not take to my yogurt idea, something good has already come from my purchase of 10 servings of Yoplait Yogurt -- each one features a lid reading Save Lids to Save Lives with a pink breast cancer ribbon printed on the pink foil top. I didn't even notice this until I was in the check-out line, but now I know that for every pink lid I send in, 10 cents will be donated to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Yoplait will contribute up to $1.5 million and guarantees a $500,000 donation. So regardless of Joey's decision regarding the yogurt, someone will benefit from this purchase -- if only I can convince Joey to save the lids.And so somehow, helping fund a cure for breast cancer seems easier than convincing my child to try new foods. Both are difficult ventures. And hopefully, a remedy will one day surface for both. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'An announcement last Wednesday revealed an overall decline in cancer death rates -- probably due to reduced exposure to tobacco, early detection, and better treatment. But the announcement also revealed a surprising jump in cases of thyroid cancer for women. Between the years 1981 and 1993, incidence rates among women climbed 2.2 percent each year. Between the years 1993 and 2000, they rose 4.6 percent per year. And between 2000 and 2003, there was a 9.1 percent increase each year. This could be a result of better diagnosis but scientists are wondering if there is an unknown risk factor contributing to this startling finding. And it will take at least two more years to determine whether this is a random fluctuation or a true trend. The rate of thyroid cancer in men has also increased but not as much as for women.The silver lining in this cancer cloud is that trends -- such as those showing increases in cancer incidences and death rates -- often fuel the fight against cancer because researchers are alerted to look for causes which ultimately results in better detection and better prevention. Comments: 1. Diagnostic criteria for thyroid tumours have changed: very small tumours used to be ignored because they are common and benign. Now they are called microcarcinoma, and the patient is counted as cancer. This change lead to what a French study jokingly calls â\\x80\\x9can epidemic of microcarcinomasâ\\x80? (references below). This explains the puzzling increase in incidence, but decrease in mortality, from thyroid cancer.EM, in Canada<A href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&amp;DB=pubmed\" rel=nofollow>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&amp;DB=pubmed</A>2. dTwo weeks ago I had a thyroid ultrasound because I asked my doctor if I could get it to check to see if maybe my thyroid isn\\'t working 100% because my metabolism has been very slow for 7 and half years since I\\'m 34 and I gained weight for the first time and had to go on a diet. My thyroid has always been checked since I was 11 when I had a thyroid scan and blood test,and another scan and blood test at 19 and blood tests at other ages including one three years ago because doctors always noticed my neck is somewhat full in the front.The tests have always been normal though. Anyway my doctor internist,called me back three days after the thyroid ultrasound to tell me I have three nodules on my thyroid. I was and am terrified I thought of some cancerous growths even though I had never even heard of thyroid nodules and I have since learned a lot on good medical web sites that most are benign and very common. I called my doctor 4 days later after I learned more about this and I asked her what did the ultrasound describe,was it anything worrisome and she said no. I asked her how many there are and how big they are and she said they are small and there is three. I asked her if I should have a biopsy on them now and she said no that she would want me to have a blood test now and another ultrasound in a few months. But I\\'m going to see an endocrinologist and probably a recommened doctor by The American Thyroid Association who is a thyroid specialist. I\\'m really scared too knowing the increase of thyroid cancer especially in women.What did the person who commented before mean? Are there much more true microcancer tumors being found or did they mean that the benign ones are so common that could almost be considered cancer?3. I think the poster just meant that more tumors are being diagnosed because the criteria for calling them tumors has been adjusted down. In your case seeing an endo is a good step--they know best. And yes it\\'s scary, but most nodules are indeed benign.Regards,Richard Day Gore',\n",

       " 'The most recent season of MTV\\'s Real World/Road Rules Challenge reality show has just ended. Customary after each season finale is a reunion show -- where a sampling of contestants recap their experiences, answer questions, confirm or dispel show rumors, and update viewers on the status of their post-television lives. The winners -- a twosome who took home $250,000 -- sit front and center at the reunion and get to bask in the glory of the physical and mental prowess that allowed them to win the big bucks. Two contestants clearly won -- they have the money to prove it. But another contestant -- who didn\\'t take home a dime -- is the true winner in my book.Diem Brown, 25, was cast on the MTV challenge show before she knew she had ovarian cancer. But prior to the start of the show, Brown did know of her diagnosis -- and she still decided after just a few treatments to head for Australia where she competed in physical stunts and tough competitions. The producers never knew of Brown\\'s illness and she confided in only two castmates while she battled through fatigue and nausea to complete her own personal survival mission. She succeeded -- and she returned home victorious in her own right. And she has no regrets. On the reunion show, Brown said the show made her more fierce, that she came out of the experience a stronger person, that she tried her hardest, put everything on the line, and didn\\'t feel sorry for herself. And it put her mindset in a great place prior to returning home for continued treatment.And now Brown is home. She is receiving treatment. And she is managing her foundation -- Live for the Challenge -- a wedding-type registrywhere patients can register for wigs, prescriptions, anything critical to the management of their illness. Ovarian cancer affects one in 50 women, mostly in a silent fashion -- with no overt symptoms until it\\'s often too late. And there is currently no accurate screening for this life-threatening disease that can have tragic outcomes.Brown seems to be managing just fine with the cancer she calls \"the disease that whispers.\" She is strong, spunky, enthusiastic and positive about life, about her future. She is clearly a winner. Comments: 1. This girl is a fraud! Her Cancer story seems bogus. I am going through it and the way she described chemo was like it was a joke! Why hasnt her hair fallen out and it seems to me she did this to garner some attention or perhaps seal her spot on reality tv. Rude!2. Casie of Comment #1. You don\\'t know that she is a fraud based on this article. Some different in treatments don\\'t always cause hair loss. Maybe she only had radiation! I know I lost my hair, but everyone doesn\\'t always respond the same. Also at the beginning my treatments did not really cause me much of a loss of energy or any nausea. As time went on, it got worse. The really dangerous thing I found about Diem\\'s reaction was her delaying treatment for the show. Seems to me when our cancer is often found too late, any delay is playing with your life. I\\'m lucky--it was found at an early stage, now,one year after treatment, I seem to be one of the survivors.3. Diem\\'s hair did fall out. It wasn\\'t easy for her, but she tried to stay positive. She is the oldest of 4, and is kind of a mother figure to her brother and sisters. They lost their mother a few years ago and this was very difficult for all of them to deal with. Cancer treatment is hard no matter what type you have. Every one deals with it differently, and if she can be positive even on her worst days, then more power to her.',\n",
       " 'The CyberKnife -- a powerful new weapon in the war on cancer -- involves no cutting, like the name implies. This robotic system instead uses hundreds of focused radiation beams to destroy a tumor. A robotic arm moves around the patient and an image-guided system tracks the targeted tumor. CyberKnife delivers small blasts of radiation from up to 200 angles and keeps the tumor in its sights at all times. CyberKnife treatments are completed in one to five days which is just one of the benefits of this therapy compared to traditional radiation therapy.With traditional radiation, patients often endure treatment for five to eight weeks. And healthy tissue can be destroyed every time the patient shifts or breathes. The CyberKnife attacks the cancerous tumor only -- even while the patient breathes. CyberKnife therapy, available in only 50 hospitals in the United States, requires no mold to position patients, can treat anywhere in the body, and can help patients who no longer respond to traditional treatments.CyberKnife is covered by insurance and approved by Medicare.

My search turned up Yoplait yogurt even though I wasn\\'t quite sure how my find would be received by my finicky guy. And so I write today with an update.Joey loved the yogurt. He gobbled it up and came home after his first serving asking if I had purchased different flavors. I told him I did -- and he can\\'t wait to try them all. And he is doing a super job of bringing home the pink foil lids that cover each yogurt container -- the lids that if saved and sent to Yoplait will result in a donation to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Yoplait will donate 10 cents for each lid they receive prior to December 31, 2006 -- and so Joey is hard at work saving his lids. I have always been honest with Joey about my own breast cancer. When he was just four years old and I was newly diagnosed, I told him I had a \"boo-boo\" in my \"boobie\" and that a doctor would take it out. I told him I would take medicine that would make my hair fall out -- and Joey helped shave my head when my hair began falling out in clumps. He knows cancer is the reason for my endless doctoring, he knows my port is where medicine enters my body, and he checks in with me now and then about my progress. Just recently he asked after yet another doctor appointment, \"Won\\'t you be so happy when you can be healthy all by yourself?\" Yes, I said as I helped him minimally comprehend this illness that is simply a way of life to him now. And as he collects his pink yogurt lids, he asks, \"Are these for cancer?\" I tell him in a way I think he\\'ll understand, \"Yes, they will help raise money for other people who need to feel better.\" And my response makes Joey happy.

       " 'Ryder Cup golfer Darren Clarke lost his wife Heather to breast cancer last month. Clarke has not played competitively since July 21 when he took time off from golfing to care for his wife. Since her passing, Clarke has been thinking and regrouping and mourning the loss of his 39-year-old wife and mother of their two young sons. Now, he is ready to re-enter the world of golf. He is ready, he says, for the upcoming Ryder Cup.Clarke says his game is good and while his decision to return to his sport was tough, he is returning only because he knows he can fully contribute. And he knows his wife would have wanted him to play so he made himself available for selection. Clarke could not have qualified automatically due to the time he took off to care for Heather but he was eligible to be selected -- and he was. Clarke is grateful and prepared for the challenge. \"I am stronger altogether,\" he says. \"I\\'ve had to face up a lot of tough things. I hope I\\'ve come through it a better person.\" Comments: 1. well that here to say... Wish to win Darren Clarke... let will show a competitor what you are capable on2.

       " \"One lucky couple was chosen -- from a pool of more than 450 couples who competed in ESPN's Marriage Madness competition -- as winner of the ultimate ESPN sports wedding. With listeners of the Mike &amp; Mike in the Morning national TV and radio show as voters, Catherine and Jason West, now husband and wife, were married May 26, 2006 on ESPN. Noteworthy is the fact that both Catherine and Jason are die-hard University of Florida Gator fans -- they met at a Gator tailgating party and were engaged at Lake Alice, a popular outdoor spot on campus. The bride wore crystal Gator beadwork on her gown and the groom's tuxedo jacket was lined in Gator orange. The maid of honor wore a Gator blue dress and carried an orange bouquet. The wedding vows included the traditional messages of love, honor, and respect -- but some sports twists were sprinkled in too. The Wests took away a check for $20,000, compliments of hosts Mike Greenberg and Mike Golic, and they will soon head off on an all-expense paid sports-inspired honeymoon.This wedding is inspired not just by sports.&nbsp; It is also inspired by cancer survival. Catherine -- who became engaged on the one-year anniversary of her first breast cancer surgery -- is now in full cancer remission. And a $2,500 donation was made in the couple's name to the V Foundation, a cancer fund in memory of Jim Valvano, a former North Carolina State basketball coach and ESPN broadcaster. This is surely an event to remember. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"Numbness is wearing off, and I am beginning to feel twinges of pain surrounding the area where my port was once located. I can't see what was done to me today -- because the area is carefully bandaged -- but I know from what I feel that my skin has been cut and sewn back together. I feel the skin tightening, stretching, pulsing and while it's not terribly comfortable, it's pretty minor compared to the pain of so many other cancer procedures -- like my lumpectomy, my chemotherapy, my nausea, my neutropenia, my allergic reactions to various medications.So I am fine, following my port removal that was predicted to last a few hours but somehow took most of the day. The actual procedure took just one hour, and the twilight drug that kept me in a peaceful funk allowed me to relax while the port that was tunneled into the tissue underneath my skin was precisely taken from my body. It was an uneventful experience -- except for a few tears that dripped from my eyes during the final moments before my surgery. I think it may have been the power of the moment -- the moment signaling the end of my active cancer journey. Or it may have been the power of support offered by my sister and my three-year-old son who accompanied me today. Or it may have been the power of the response I gave a nurse who had just seen my little guy and asked me if I planned to have more children. My response -- probably not, because of cancer -- seemed a little too final, a little too sad.It may have been the combination of everything, all adding up over the past two years, that brought tears to my eyes today. But for now, the tears are gone. And the port is gone. For now, my cancer is gone. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"Breast cancer is widespread -- so widespread that most of us have direct personal contact with someone living with this disease. Information about breast cancer is also widespread -- so widespread that it's easy to get lost in the maze of details that define this illness that two million women in the United States are living with at this very moment. Breast cancer has its own set of definitions and facts and statistics -- and myths too. And here are seven myths that are not worth spreading.Most lumps in the breast are cancer. Actually, most lumps in the breast are not cancer. But every lump should still be examined and diagnosed. Breast cancer does not occur in young women. While most breast cancer cases occur in women over the age of 50, breast cancer can and does occur in women of all ages. I was diagnosed at age 34.Women with large breasts have a greater risk of breast cancer. Size does not affect risk. But it can be more difficult to examine large breasts and therefore detect a suspicious lump due to a larger amount of tissue.A woman has little or no risk of breast cancer if she has has no family history of the disease.Most women with breast cancer -- about 75 percent -- have no family history of breast cancer. Simply being female puts all women at risk. I have no family history of breast cancer -- but I still was diagnosed with this disease and have been treating it for almost two years.If mammography shows nothing to worry about, then there is nothing to worry about. Mammography can miss 10 to 15 percent of all breast cancers. So any suspicious mass should be investigated with further tests -- such as ultrasound and MRI. When my lump was examined during a mammogram, my doctor was not worried. But an ultrasound that followed revealed a solid mass -- and this was something to worry about. A biopsy came next. And then came my breast cancer diagnosis.Once a woman is treated for breast cancer, she should avoid becoming pregnant.Many breast cancer survivors go on to have successful pregnancies and healthy children. Women should consult their doctors, however, about current and previous treatments and should discuss any possible concerns about pregnancy after breast cancer.Removal of the entire breast is safer than segmental mastectomy.Survival is similar for women who have breast-conserving surgery -- like a lumpectomy -- and for those who have either a total or modified mastectomy.It's not surprising that inaccurate information is floating around about breast cancer -- because there is so much information on the topic and much of it is not completely understood by those who study the disease every day. But we all can take an active part in our own education by researching each tidbit of news that comes our way. We can confirm it, deny it, and understand it better if we take matters into our own hands. And if we don't spread anything we just are not sure about. We owe it to ourselves -- and women everywhere -- to spread only the most accurate information about this disease we all need to better comprehend. Comments: \",\n",

       " \"Luis Carranza is just eight years old. And he is just a few years -- or perhaps a few months -- away from dying as a result of a weakened immune system due to aggressive treatment for leukemia. The same treatment that at one time brought remission for this boy also attacked his central nervous system, caused seizures, brought on terminal and irreversible brain damage, and eventually sent him into a vegetative state. Luis has traveled a rough road -- and so has his mother who illegally slipped him across the Mexican border into the United States in hopes of treatment to save her young son's life. Guadalupe Carranza did find salvation for her son in a Texas hospital and for more than one year, Luis received chemotherapy and radiation -- and loads of love from staff and volunteers who helped care for him. Guadalupe was not always there for her son, though, because after locating helpful health care and social services, she was deported to Mexico. She tried to return on many occasions and even received assistance from doctors, nurses, social workers, and attorneys who worked to find a legal way to unite Guadalupe and Luis. But not until Luis fell into a coma did efforts pay off.After negotiation with border and consulate officials, Guadalupe was granted a humanitarian parole visa and legally crossed into the United States on May 8. The visa allowed her 60 days -- but officials agreed to let her stay until Luis passes away. And so she stays -- by her son's bedside where he rests peacefully in a place that gave him a chance at life. A chance his mother says he never would have had in Mexico. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'It can be hard to remember when it\\'s time for check-ups and exams and screenings. Many come just once each year and with the swift passage of time, it\\'s easy to forget our medical to-do lists. But missing an appointment -- or even delaying one -- can lead to missed and delayed diagnoses. So remembering these easy-to-forget chores is key. And perhaps reminders are the key to remembering.The American Cancer Society offers a free mammogram reminder in the form of e-mail message sent each year to remind women to schedule their mammograms. It takes just a moment to register with an e-mail address and a preferred month and day of the year for this e-mail to arrive. To register for your yearly reminder, click here.The College of American Pathologists offers a free reminder service for the following appointments -- blood donation, cholesterol screening, colon cancer screening, diabetes test, pap test, and mammogram. Click here to choose one or more of these options that also require just just an e-mail address and preferred month and date for delivery.So forget that string around your finger -- reach for your computer keyboard right now. It takes just a few keystrokes to ensure prompt testing for the health issues that if detected early, can save our lives. Comments: 1. Yearly screening saves lives. There are so many things that we canNOT control - that we do not have the answers to..... one of the most important things we can do for ourselves, as women, is to go in for our annual gyn visit. So many women avoid getting into the stirrups - they feel it is invasive and uncomfortable. But getting into the stirrups can save your life.Cervical cancer is preventable. We know what causes it - HPV - a very common virus that most women will get at some point in their lives. When you go in for your annual gyn visit, the pap test is measuring for cellular changes, caused by the virus, on your cervix. Catching these changes at an early stage can make all the difference. The problem - is that the pap test can be wrong up to 50% of the time - telling you that you are fine, when you are not.The pap used to be the only tool available to women. Now there is another test - the HPV test - that can tell a woman if she is carrying HPV and is at risk for cervical cancer BEFORE changes happen... BEFORE it becomes invasive and necessary for TRULY invasive procedures like a hysterectomy, chemo, and radiation. Knowing your HPV status is critical in taking control of your cervical health. If you find out you have HPV, you can work with your doctor to be monitored more closely, boost your immune system, and ultimately catch the celluar changes at an early stage - thus preventing invasive cervical cancer. Now THAT is empowering.I talk about this all the time. Why? Because I am a woman that thought I was doing everything right. I always went in for my pap, every year since I was 18. Then, at 31, I was diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer with extensive lymphatic invasion. The pap failed me. It told me every single year that I was fine. I wasn\\'t. I had to have everything - hysterectomy, radiation, chemo, and internal radiation. I don\\'t want one other woman to go through that..... it doesn\\'t have to happen. That\\'s why I talk about it all the time.So please, women, talk to one another. Talk to your doctor. Go in for your annual visit and ask - \"are you giving me the very best? are you giving me a liquid pap? are you giving me the HPV test? I want to use every tool available to prevent cervical cancer.\" Why? Because you can.So go tie that string around your finger ladies. Trust me - it\\'s worth it.2. As an internist and patient empowerment expert, I wanted to thank you for encouraging visitors to your site to seek out preventative medical screening tests. However, it is also important to educate women about the importance of the human papillomavirus (HPV) test â\\x80\\x93 the cause of cervical cancer â\\x80\\x93 for use in combination with the Pap test.Multiple studies have shown that the Pap alone isnâ\\x80\\x99t fool-proof, but by administering an HPV test along with the Pap in women age 30 and older (those most likely to have a high-risk form of HPV that if persistent can cause cervical cancer), screening accuracy can be improved to nearly 100 percent. Once doctors know a woman is infected with a persistent, high-risk type of HPV, intervention can be initiated sooner rather than later â\\x80\\x93 well before cancer has a chance to develop.This is information every woman needs to know today to assure that she does not become a victim to one of the few types of cancers that can actually be prevented. So next visit, ask your doctor about the HPV test along with the Pap test - and give your doctor a self-addressed stamped envelope to send you a copy of your own test results too.

       " 'Actress Mariska Hargitay lost her father on Thursday to multiple myeloma. Mickey Hargitay, the 1955 Mr. Universe, Mr. America, Mr. Olympia, and one-time husband of late sex symbol Jayne Mansfield died at the age of 80 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.Born Miklos Hargitay in Hungary, Mickey emigrated to the United States after World War II. Here he entered the world of bodybuilding and then landed a role in Mae West\\'s Las Vegas Revue. Mansfield, who saw the show in 1956, married Hargitay in 1958 -- and the two later had daughter Mariska and two other children. Mansfield and Hargitay divorced in 1964 -- and Mansfield died in a car crash in 1967.Family members shared in a statement to the media, \"words cannot express how saddened we are by the loss of Mickey. At the same time, we are so grateful for who he was and is to all of us, and for the love he gave us in our lives. He will continue to be our source of inspiration and strength.\" Hargitay, also know for a few Hercules-style movies, is survived by his wife of 38 years, Ellen, a daughter, a stepdaughter, two sons, a brother, a sister, 10 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Comments: 1. I was hoping to get this note to Mairska personally my thoughts have been with her as 10 years ago I lost my father to Multiple Miloma after only a 7 month battle. We were unfortunately living in Monterey California while my husband was assigned to the Naval Post Graduate school. He was diagnosed the day before our twins were born at level four with six weeks to live. It was a difficult time for the whole family. He was stalwart and brave in his battle and stayed confidant through the whole seven months until he could not regain his strength after having a marrow transplant. Mother ran him to the hospital one day as he stopped breathing. He died two weeks later after battling pnuemonia. He is greatly missed as my sons become teenagers, boy scouts getting their Eagles. He is a missed influence in the lives of our children. My heart is with you Mariska, we share a great loss and I morn with you. Hold your son a little tighter, and remember your father as he is a part of your son a will carry on in your self each day of your life. 2. I, too, lost my father to multiple myleoma in February of this year. He was diagnosed in May of 2004, and put up a brave and hard fight. He was admitted to the hospital in January with pneumonia and passed away on February 15th. My mom, our family and I miss him every day. My thoughts and prayers are with Mariska and her family as well as the previous person who posted; I know the path they walk, and it\\'s a difficult one. Also, no matter their age, they are still our parents. ',\n",
       " \"There's a bit of breast cancer news in just about every magazine out there -- news about treatments and protocols and studies, news about celebrity diagnoses, news about lives lost to breast cancer and lives conquering breast cancer, news that is scattered here and there and everywhere. But now, there is a magazine all about breast cancer -- and just about breast cancer. All sorts of breast cancer wisdom is conveniently packaged into one slick, glossy publication that debuted on newsstands yesterday, September 19.Beyond: Live &amp; Thrive After Breast Cancer is a semi-annual publication from Meredith Special Interest Media, part of the Meredith Corporation -- a leading media and marketing company and home to magazines such as Better Homes and Gardens, Ladies' Home Journal, Parents, and Fitness. Meredith's new breast cancer venture provides women living with the disease -- and those who may one day encounter it -- with support and with the latest information on treatment and recovery. The Fall/Winter 2006 premiere issue of Beyond features a cover story about Dallas Mayor Laura Miller, a survivor forging ahead into a life beyond breast cancer. Also filling the pages are inspiring real-life profiles and stories, nutritional advice, up-do-date medical information, fashion tips, the Pink Pages -- a resource guide that details upcoming races and products that support breast cancer -- and much more.Behind the scenes of this issue is an advisory board of leading experts in the breast cancer field. Experts include Susan Brown, the health manager at Susan G. Komen Foundation; Carolyn M. Kaelin, director of Comprehensive Breast Health Center and breast cancer survivor; and Lillie Shockney, Administrative Director at Johns Hopkins Breast Cancer.If there is one theme common to women surviving breast cancer, it must be the desire to live beyond the control of this life-threatening and life-changing illness, to recapture an existence that resembles something normal, to embark on a journey outside the confines of cancer. Tips, techniques, strategies, and inspiration for accomplishing these feats are printed on the pages of this new magazine that is sure to reach its intended audience -- that today includes two million women who are living with breast cancer.

A few years ago you wouldn't have been able to imagine a nice glossy magazine devoted to cancer and cancer survivors, particularly a cancer that afflicts women. It really goes to show how far we've come in terms of awareness and acceptance that breast cancer can get its own glossy magazine. Here's to peeling back the stigma so cancer patients and survivors don't have to hide their afflictions (and achievements) in the shadows. Good work!Regards,Richard Day Gore17.

       " \"I have had a hard time keeping my counseling appointments lately. Life keeps getting in the way, and counseling keeps getting pushed to the side. The last time I called my counselor to cancel -- due to an emergency room trip with my three-year-old -- I mentioned that my inability to keep up with sessions was perhaps a precursor to an eventual termination of our counseling relationship. My counselor -- Lindsay -- said this was maybe an accurate assessment, that we should discuss the possibility of an ending point. We haven't yet discussed it, though, because I have not made the time to contact her. I have continued to leave counseling on the back burner. But today Lindsay sent me an e-mail to check in. She wrote that I am probably going to be okay on my own now -- in the aftermath of cancer -- and that we should have one final session to reflect on my progress over the past 16 months. I have not replied to Lindsay -- not because I am busy with other things but simply because her words made me cry. They still make me cry, hours later. I'm not exactly sure why. And I'm not exactly sure how I will follow up on scheduling my very last session.I assume my tears -- my sadness -- are part of the healing process, part of the separation anxiety I feel each time a part of my treatment ends and a part of my life moves on. I assume I am sad at the prospect of leaving a vital part of my recovery behind, about leaving the comfort of my counseling chair, about leaving Lindsay. The possibilities are endless. And I suppose we will cover all possibilities when Lindsay and I sit down for our last, final, concluding session -- when we recall how much I have grown since the day we first met, when I could barely mutter a word about cancer without weeping uncontrollably, when I could barely manage to find pleasure in my days, when I could barely imagine that life could -- and would -- offer me peace and happiness.Today, life is good. And it's clear that counseling is no longer necessary for my survival. But that doesn't make it any easier to make my final appointment. To contemplate saying my last goodbye. To tackle life completely on my own. Which is what I will do -- in time -- so I can continue moving on, away from breast cancer. Comments: 1. Once we finish treatment and get back to life, the relationships we formed with caregivers, therapists, etc. taper off and we feel a sense of loss. Those individuals helped us stay strong through a very difficult time it is only natural to feel some anxiety as you move forward without them.2. I found myself struggling from any references to my previous normal life before diagnosis. My daughter was 6 months old when I was diagnosed and rather then spend all my time with her, I needed to create bounderies to protect her from my chaotic life of treatment. My new normal has taken several years to adjust too....and still I'm trying to figure it why I've seperated myself from sharing my experiences with my support network of therapists, hypno-therapist, psychiatrist, etc....Your not alone. Stay healthy and easy on yourself ;)\",\n",
       " \"I will be a cancer survivor for the rest of my life. I don't think my modeling career will have that kind of longevity, though. I gave it a try -- I am not sure how I was convinced to participate as a model in a fashion show when my personality is so not conducive to strutting on a runway -- and I think I will retire after my short stint in the spotlight. The spotlight was my biggest problem really. When I walked out on stage -- two times -- I was blinded by bright lights shining in my eyes and was somewhat paralyzed by the total darkness I saw in the audience of about 700 people who came to watch me and 84 other cancer survivors this past March in the Cure by Design fashion show, sponsored by my local American Cancer Society office. I heard clapping and shouting and cheering but could not see anything in front of me. I had no sense of where my family members sat in the crowd and felt disoriented and confused. It didn't help that I had to follow arrows that were taped on the stage -- reminders of the path I had to travel on stage -- and had to wave and smile and look relaxed. Relaxed I was not -- and I am sure it was obvious to those whose faces I never could see. I am not the model pictured above -- the model who looks poised and polished and comfortable -- but I was a model who, despite the anxiety of it all, was fully moved and touched and amazed by this event that raised more than $175,000 for the American Cancer Society of Alachua County. Models ranged in age from 18 months to 80 years. Men, women, and children -- all survivors of cancer -- joined together in friendship and survivorship. We mingled in our dressing rooms, were treated to professional hair and make-up services, enjoyed food and refreshments, and were honored by a banquet after the show. It was quite an experience -- and it is so thrilling to know that through ticket sales and donations and an auction afterwards that so much money was raised for future efforts in the fight against cancer.I am not sure if I will resume my role as model in next year's show -- I may be more of a behind-the-scenes person -- but I do know that Cure by Design is an event that enlightened me and inspired me and reminded me that I am surely not alone.

       " 'Stomach cancer is hard to detect. It has no symptoms in its early stages, and there is no effective screening to detect its presence. So early detection and early treatment for this disease -- that attacks 800,000 people worldwide -- are hard to come by. In Taiwan, stomach cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the focus of study for researchers working to devise a method for detecting stomach cancer in its infancy.A team of researchers at National Taiwan University Hospital have discovered a toxic factor -- GroES -- that causes stomach cancer. And they have discovered that a simple blood test will show either a positive or negative result for this substance, leading to immediate endoscopic exams for patients who may be at risk for stomach cancer. The test to identify GroES has already achieved a 65 percent accuracy rate.Apparently, if the human body is infected with GroES, it produces antibodies to the factor and can cause chronic inflammation of the stomach, causing cells to rupture and proliferate. Long-term inflammation can cause stomach cancer. Researchers say about 45 percent of adults in Taiwan are infected with GroES -- and one percent will go on to develop stomach cancer.Right now, patent applications are underway in the United States, Japan, and Taiwan. Once a kit is developed, a single drop of blood will be all it takes to determine the risk for stomach cancer. Comments: 1. Below is a link to the abstract of the original article. Frankly, this is very interesting. From the abstract, let me try to clarify this post:1. Stomach cancer is caused by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (HP). This bug also causes gastritis and stomach ulcers. 2. Not all HP are bad. Therefore, researchers are looking for a test that separates bad HP from good HP.3.This team from Taiwan looked at antibodies in the blood of patients with an HP infection, comparing those with cancer with those without. They identified several interesting bacterial proteins.4.The most promising is called GroES. 64% of cancer patients had antibodies to GroES, compared to 31% to 36% without cancer. 5. This GroES protein from HP is known since at least 1995. But this is the first time that it is accused of causing cancer. 6. The authors propose to use this blood test as cheap screening for gastric cancer. If the test is positive, further investigation (gastroscopy and biopsy) is recommended. 7. It is much too soon to ask this test from your doctor. First, this observation needs to be repeated by other teams.

       " \"I think it's safe to say that a large amount of women in this world lack self confidence. Tack on a few incisions and scars, some lop-sided or altogether missing breasts, a handful of scattered blue tattoos, a head full of newly sprouting hair, swelling arms, drug-damaged fingernails and toenails, damaged veins, alien-like ports protruding from underneath skin, unpredictable hot flashes, and a foggy brain and it's clear that women surviving breast cancer may have a few of their own issues concerning self confidence. It doesn't take science to prove this reality -- although there are studies out there that do confirm and validate that breast cancer survivors struggle with positive self images.Results of a study released Wednesday reveal that the vast majority of breast cancer patients in Taiwan lose self confidence after having their breasts removed. The study shows that 90 percent of participants feel they have lost their beauty and femininity following a mastectomy. Women worry about their partner's perception of them after such radical appearance changes. They doubt their roles in their workplace and families. They are even afraid of having sex with their partners. And if the patients' relationship with their spouses are not good in the first place, breast removal surgery will lead to divorce about 10 percent of the time.There is no doubt that female roles vary from country to country -- and what studies show in Taiwan may not be completely applicable to women in the United States. But there is one universal truth that knows no boundaries -- all women recovering from the ravages of breast cancer will encounter struggles. Because breast cancer does not discriminate when it comes to compromising the self esteem of its targets. Comments: 1. Oh so true however in my case my depleting self esteem is not from the loss of a breast etc it is (for me personally) from the loss of cognitive abilities that chemo creates and from the loss of jobs and lively hood. \",\n",
       " 'Each month, about 22,000 women log on to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) web site and answer seven questions to determine their risk of developing invasive breast cancer. The Gail Model, named for the NCI\\'s chief biostatistician, Mitchell H. Gail, generates a five-year risk and a lifetime risk for each woman who answers each of these seven questions.   Does the woman have a medical history of any breast cancer or of any   ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)? Note:   This assessment tool cannot accurately predict risk for a woman who already   has a medical history of breast cancer.  What is the woman\\'s age? Note: This tool only calculates risk for women   ages 35 and older.  What was the woman\\'s age at the time of her first menstrual period?   What was the woman\\'s age at the time of her first live birth of a child?     How many of the woman\\'s first-degree relatives -- mother, sisters,   daughters -- have had breast cancer?   Has the woman ever had a breast biopsy? How many breast biopsies has the   woman had? Has the woman had at least one breast biopsy with atypical   hyperplasia?   What is the woman\\'s race/ethnicity? A simple drop-down answer menu is provided for each question, and explanations for each question are available. Upon completion of the short survey, the Gail Model spits out a five-year breast cancer risk and a lifetime breast cancer risk with comparisons to the general population of women.While this is only an assessment -- based on statistics that do not always take into account individual differences -- it is still a helpful tool. Because it\\'s clear that women can minimize breast cancer risk with behavior changes and sometimes medication. And generating a personal rating on risk is a rating worth knowing. It\\'s also worth knowing that this tool was designed for use by health professionals. If you are not a health professional, consider discussing your results with your doctor. Comments: 1.

My sister is the one who was born with the athletic streak -- she played softball and lettered in tennis after giving the sport a try with no previous experience and may have helped her high school basketball team win a state championship if it weren't for the major knee injury she suffered just before the big game. I, on the other hand, was born with a streak that has something to do with hair, nails, and lots of shoes. I was never interested in sports, gym shorts, or sweating -- which is what makes running three miles a big deal for me. I wish I had started running long ago -- because I really like it. I like the loud music that pumps through my MP3 player and the change in my cadence as each new song begins. I like the motivation of knowing I'm pushing my body and accomplishing a physical challenge. I like that my endurance improves with each mile I travel. I like the mental release and the thoughts that run through my head and the cleansing effect I get from running. And I like sweating.It's possible running would not have appealed to me long ago, even if I had given it a try -- because times were different long ago. I was healthy. I was happy. And I had no reason to marvel at the possibilities of my body. Without a natural impulse for physical fitness and challenge, I was completely satisfied with the status quo. But now I have an acquired impulse -- because cancer has threatened the very body I once took for granted. And I want it to be strong. I want it to be healthy. I want it to stand up to any possible threat. So I run. And when I am not running, I look forward to running. In just a few weeks, I will run in the 5K Making Strides for Breast Cancer event with my athletic sister. I will run by her side. With my loud music for motivation. With the inspiration that I am making a difference for my body and for women everywhere. With my gym shorts on. And a ball cap covering my hair. With sweat dripping down my face. I can't imagine a better feeling. Comments: 1. Good for you getting out there and running Iâ\\x80\\x99m impressed!!!!I started running also for health reasons but not as drastic as you.

She received the same treatment as I did -- lumpectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation -- and so I was especially interested in her breast cancer journey as it paralleled my own in many ways. But just after her diagnosis surfaced in the media, Elizabeth Edwards disappeared from the radar -- perhaps like we all do in some way while immersed in the maze of cancer. So I lost track of her. But now -- almost two years later -- Edwards is back from cancer, back in the headlines, and back with a new book, Saving Grace.Edwards, 57, reveals on the pages of her book the intricacies of her cancer ordeal. She shares that she experienced every side effect possible throughout her treatment. She bruised, bled, developed sores in her mouth, experienced numbness in her hands and feet, lost her hair, felt nauseated, ached in her bones and joints, and suffered yellowed and damaged nails -- and then chemotherapy stopped and she went on to the burning, blistering effects of radiation. Still, she managed to survive. And she thanks those who helped her survive -- for their tenderness, encouragement, humor, tears, and love -- and she writes all about it in her memoir that reveals how she juggled life and marriage and kids and cancer and how she arrived in a new place. A happy place. Comments: 1. It was Nov.7th 2004. Katie Couric was interviewing Elizabeth Edwards on the Today Show. I was getting ready for work and at that moment I decided to do a breast self-exam. I found a lump. It was cancer and I too went on my journey to recovery. It seemed like the 200th time Katie Couric had interviewed someone with breast cancer, but because of her perseverance in bringing the issue up again and again, that day I got the message and it saved my life. Thank you Elizabeth for your courage and thank you Katie for keeping us abreast of what we need to do. 2.

       " \"I always notice women wearing ball caps. I wore them almost every day while I received chemotherapy last year. I used them to cover my bald head -- along with wigs made for ball caps -- because I never could muster up the courage to show the world what was happening to me. So I look at others who wear these hats and wonder if they wear them for the same reason I did. Most times, I can tell they are worn for nothing more than fashion or for a means to disguise a bad hair day -- but there are times when I spot a ball cap that covers the battle scars of a war with cancer. And this makes me sad. And proud. And connected to these women who share an experience with me -- even though we never meet or speak or realize the bond we share. It's like watching another mom with a brand new baby in a stroller -- and knowing how it feels to be that mom with a new life at her fingertips and all the joy and potential (and lack of sleep and worry and tantrums) that lie ahead. It's a silent sisterhood -- being a mom in the world with other moms and being a cancer survivor in the world with other cancer survivors.I never thought ball caps would be so important in my life.

       " \"Breast density has something to do with breast cancer. This is not really news. It's clear there is some kind of link, some kind of relationship, some kind of risk related to breast density for both pre- and post-menopausal women. It's just not clear how exactly breast density -- how much fat tissue fills the breast compared to other tissue -- contributes to breast cancer risk. But once it is clear, medical professionals will have a whole new arsenal of power in the fight against this deadly disease.Cancer News in Context, a regular series of podcast commentaries produced by the Harvard Center for Cancer Prevention, highlights two recent studies that add weight to the fact that breast density is an important tool in breast cancer prediction and identifies two areas that with futher study might help determine why breasts that are very dense are associated with higher risks for breast cancer -- and why density may be as important a factor as age in determining risk.Currently, mammograms are the chosen method for measuring breast density. But measurement is not required, and there are no national standards for how to measure. Once federal groups issue requirements and direction on how to classify density, women will receive more accurate assessments of their personal risk.There is also speculation that altering breast density through hormonal therapy may lower risk. Perhaps genetics are the strongest indicator of risk, making short-term solutions ineffective, but perhaps certain interventions can override genetics, helping women protect themselves from breast cancer.There are many issues that must be ironed out before we really understand how breast density affects breast cancer. There is no doubt that density, when added to other risk factors, will surely help improve the accuracy of prediction. It's one tool, among many, that is poised to open all sorts of doors.

       " 'Danny became aware of my port just before it was removed. He was only 18 months old when I was diagnosed with breast cancer, and my journey went pretty much unnoticed by this small boy who had no idea ports were not standard on every person he met. Now he is three years old and even though he still has no real idea why a port popped up from underneath my skin for two years, he did come to realize it was something akin to a boo-boo that one day goes away. My port went away on September 15. And ever since that day, Danny has been very concerned about the incision that marks the spot once home to a foreign device. For one week after my port removal, my incision was covered. Danny wondered why. I told him I was healing, that I had to keep my boo-boo protected, that I could not take a shower because it could not get wet. Danny was very attentive. He pulled at the neck of my shirt every time I held him to sneak a peak at the site of my surgery. He asked if it hurt, if doctors cut me with a knife, if new skin was growing underneath my bandage. \"Yes\", \"yes\", and \"yes.\" I told him. And one day when I decided to take a shower, despite orders to keep the area completely dry, Danny said, \"The doctor said you cannot take a shower.\" I told him, \"I know.\" And he said, \"But actually you did take a shower.\" I told him he was right and hoped he would not pursue my disobedience any further. He did not -- he was just checking up on me, he was just concerned about me, he was just wondering if I may have compromised something. I told him I was fine.I did not do any damage with my rebellious shower, my bandage is off, and Danny only peeks once in a while to monitor the area.

       " \"If we made no further progress in breast cancer research from this day on, the number of women dying from breast cancer five years from now would still drop substantially because we've progressed so much over the past few years, says MD Eric Winer in the October 2006 issue of Oprah magazine. Winer, director of the Breast Oncology Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, is right. There has been a lot of progress. Breast cancer research is on a roll. And here are seven reasons why.   Research has paved the way for hormonal drugs that starve tumors of   estrogen -- so for women who are estrogen and progesterone positive, drugs   like Tamoxifen may be the key for protection against a return of breast   cancer.   Targeted drug Herceptin can cut the risk of recurrence by 50 percent in   women whose tumors produce too much HER2 protein. And while Herceptin was once   believed to be effective mostly in women with advanced-stage breast cancer,   studies now show it is also effective for early-stage disease when combined   with traditional chemotherapy.   When Herceptin fails to work in late-stage disease, experimental targeted   drug Tykerb becomes an option for HER2 positive women.   Researchers are close to pinpointing who exactly will benefit from   chemotherapy with tests that analyze gene activity and can predict a   likelihood of recurrence. One such test -- Oncotype DX -- is already offering   promise.   Improved imaging options are offering doctors more than one way to look   inside the breast. Although mammograms are still the standard screening tool,   digital tests are catching more cancers in certain women -- and other imaging   techniques are under study. One day, doctors may be able to view cross   sections of the breast in 3D format to determine breast cancer that may not be   recognized on mammogram.   Genetic counseling and testing is emerging as a standard option for women   who choose to consider likelihood of gene mutations, likelihood of breast   cancer recurrence, and likelihood of additional cancer diagnoses. And for   women with a family history of breast cancer, genetic testing can help in   determining the need for regular monitoring and potential prophylactic   measures.   Scientists have recently discovered a fast-growing type of tumor, called   basal-like breast cancer, which is more prevalent in African-Americans. It may   be one reason African-Americans are more likely to die-- and die at a younger   age -- than their white counterparts. Clearly, breast cancer research is rolling right along. And hopefully -- for the sake of women everywhere -- its momentum will stay strong. Comments: \",\n",

She would have preferred red or purple, colors that signify strength and power. But pink is what we've got -- and I happen to be okay with it.I'm okay with pink because I like the color.

If I buy a pink vacuum cleaner and am reminded of the words breast and cancer each time I suck up dirt from my carpet, then I'm in the loop -- even if minimally. And if it prompts me to check my own breasts or schedule a screening appointment, then I benefit. I'm not sure a green vacuum cleaner would have the same effect. And when I wear my new Key to the Cure t-shirt -- with a pink ribbon gracing the front -- and someone inquires about the shirt, I will have an opportunity to spread some words about breast cancer. Pink doesn't have to be wimpy. It can be powerful.There are surely companies out there taking advantage of the color pink because it sells. But if sales truly benefit breast cancer research, then it's a win-win situation in my opinion. I am happy that $31 of my $35 t-shirt goes directly to breast cancer initiatives. Sure, the shirt was a bit expensive. But so is breast cancer -- and I have the bills to prove it -- so if simply buying a pink ribbon t-shirt allows me to walk around as a billboard and allows breast cancer research some more momentum, then I am game.I will wear my new shirt when I run in the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer 5K event in two weeks. And I will wear a bright pink ribbon in my hair. And I may even wear pink shorts. Because I think pink is empowering. And I'm happy it's everywhere -- because it illustrates that breast cancer is everywhere. And that is not okay. Comments: \",\n",

       " \"The breast cancer chemotherapy drug Adriamycin is often called The Red Devil. It's red in color and devilish in it's attack on both cancer cells and healthy cells. After her own personal attack by this drug, Katherine Russell Rich wrote a book, and she called it The Red Devil: To Hell with Cancer -- and Back. It's her account of how she got sick at the age of 32 with a relentless form of breast cancer. Although she was given just a short period of time to survive, Rich conquered cancer. And years later, she is alive and well. And she has discovered -- by mere coincidence -- that her book years ago inspired a group of women in Baltimore who are helping breast cancer patients through kind deeds. They foot the bill for transportation costs, housecleaning, and massage. They pick up and deliver medications. They gather and hug and eat. They take strolls. They call themselves The Red Devils.Rich only found out about The Red Devils support group when a friend noticed a mention of the group in a newspaper. She informed Rich who visited the group's website. What she found took her breath away. It seems a woman named Lark Schulze had at one time been desperate to learn about young women with stage IV breast cancer -- the same stage her 30-year-old daughter faced -- and she could not find any helpful resources. Until she came across Rich's book and poured herself into one woman's story. Moved by Rich's words, she tried to locate her, with no luck. So she took what she gathered from the book and after losing her daughter 19 months after diagnosis, became a founding member of a powerful support group -- The Red Devils -- in late 2002.Despite failed attempts at finding Rich, Schulze says Rich changed her life. And now that the women have connected, Rich says Schulze has changed her life. At first Rich was afraid to be drawn into Schulze's world. But with a hunger to understand breast cancer from a mother's perspective, Rich took the plunge. She talked to Schulze, visited her, strolled with her, and soon the hard lump she'd carried in her stomach for so long began to soften as she connected in a deep and bizarre way with a woman she had inspired -- a woman she had never before known.

       " 'Adriene Hughes was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after her 44th year of living. She found her lump after participating in a 5K walk, which for some reason, caused her breast to swell. The swelling led her to the lump -- and that\\'s how she discovered her cancer. Adriene lives in Southern California, works as a media specialist, and spends her time taking photographs, knitting, and baking cookies and breads.I have never met Adriene, have never spoken with Adriene. But we have communicated through our on-line journals and through e-mail ever since November 2004 -- when we each received a breast cancer diagnosis that changed the course of our lives forever.Adriene is a gem, a treasure, a true inspiration. And here are her words.When were you diagnosed with breast cancer?November of 2004How old were you at the time of diagnosis?44 years oldDo you have a family history of breast cancer?No family history, but that is usually the case for most women. I was told by the geneticist that only 2 percent of women who learn of breast cancer have familial ties.How did you find out you had breast cancer?I was participating in a University 5K walk to raise money for scholarships. It is a yearly thing we do at my work, to participate in the campus walk. On this day I walked a very fast 5K. Hours later my chest was hurting. I didn\\'t think anything of it because I was an athletic person, and I thought I pulled a muscle in my chest. That night,upon retiring to bed, my chest hurt horribly and was swollen double the size. I started to feel about my breast, and like an orb of light, the tumor was literally sitting out of my breast, a swollen knot. It hurt horribly and I knew right then and there that it was cancer. My inner voice told me so. It was as if I was given preparatory knowledge. And I cried. I cried myself to sleep. The next day I went to my doctor -- and the rest is history.How did you tell your family members about your diagnosis?I felt I had to do it in person. For some reason I was feeling rather strong, like it was a necessity, to be brave and to know from the start that I was a survivor and not a victim. When I told my father the muscles in his face went smooth and I could see the shift of shock. My mother, being of Italian stock, took me in her arms and said, \"Oh, you are going to be OK. Want some dinner?\"What types of breast cancer treatment did you receive?I received a full mastectomy of my right breast with immediate reconstruction. I underwent physical therapy for my arm after surgery for four months which helped with the cording taking place under my arm and the muscles the surgeon removed from my back to fill the concave chest. I underwent four months of chemotherapy every two weeks. I was told I did very well on chemo and actually was able to go to work on a part-time basis when I felt well enough. It is important to continue to live because it lifts the spirits to know that even through the adversity of cancer, it is important not to let it get the best of you.How did you manage through breast cancer treatment?I had several people who were instrumental. My friend, Karen Byrne, attended every chemo session with me, would bring gossip magazines, pictures, food, anything to distract me from the needle in my arm. Also my father drove me to chemo every time and would bring a plate of home-baked cookies to the nurses. They LOVED him! Also my friend Heather Morra flew out from New York just to go wig shopping with me. I think we bought five wigs in all different colors and styles. It was a very fun day. Last but not least is Patty McCabe, a uterine cancer survivor, who went through nine months of chemo while going through law school! When I was feeling funky with strange symptoms, I would simply call her and ask, \"did you experience BLAH BLAH BLAH....\" and she would let me know that everything I was going through was NORMAL. And then we would laugh and I always felt better. She told me a story, that while in law school, she forgot how to use the oven. Her brain was that fried from chemo. She had to ask her roommate to show her how to use it. That was an amazing story to me -- like many others.What has been your worst breast cancer moment?That\\'s an interesting question because I can\\'t really pin-point the worst moment. Perhaps I have forgotten the long days of chemo that seemed to drag on forever. I try not to think of my days as \"bad\" or \"the worst\" because that is simply too negative. It simply just was, and what I had to do to get to the other end of survivorship.What has been your best breast cancer moment?I kept a blog/photo journal of my experiences throughout my diagnosis and recovery stages. I surprisingly received e-mails from strangers around the world, both men and women, who wrote me to tell me their stories, and to reach out in support. I think that was a \"collective\" moment of many moments when people reached out to tell me I was in their prayers. That is how I met Jacki Donaldson. She too kept a blog and we found each other. We were destined to meet, sisters forever.How do handle anxiety and worry related to breast cancer?There is no such thing in my life as anxiety because I don\\'t make room for it. I just live life and concentrate on living a healthy day, asking my guardian angel that I may experience true happiness, and that I not only be love, but give love.How has breast cancer changed your life?This experience has completely altered my life. I am no longer unhappy about the small issues that seemed to have plagued me before diagnosis. I let the small things go, and the large ones too. It is simply unnecessary to worry about anything because everything works itself out. It always does.What lessons have you learned through breast cancer?To live my day for what it is and to take advantage of every waking moment. To tell my friends and family that I love them on a regular basis, and to give hugs. Also I have learned that though someone may love you, they are not strong enough to handle the diagnosis. They are faced with their own fears with mortality. What I found was that there are those who can be strong and stay by your side, and there are those who cannot. What I learned that though cancer affects YOU, it also affects the collective whole.Are you involved in any breast cancer support groups? Fundraisers? Organizations?I participate in the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk every year. I have a whole group of women I walk with every year now. So far we have raised over $2,000 for this year\\'s walk!What advice would you give someone newly diagnosed?To know and to live survivorship immediately. This disease is not going to get you. You are not a victim, you are simply the conduit of change.What advice would you give family members and friends of someone diagnosed with breast cancer?We, the survivors, need support, lots of it. I would say to be there in ways that you would not anticipate: to sit and not say anything, to simply be there, to help clean house, or to go on a walk. Bring them out in the sun, or a drive which would expose them to the fresh air. Getting outside, and being a part of life is truly important for revitalizing one\\'s soul.Name any breast cancer related books or other resources you would recommend.I highly suggest massage or acupuncture while going through chemo. There are resources out there, people who are experienced in treating cancer patients who can help your recover from a chemo session. Also seek physical therapy after your surgeries. The hands-on, proactive approach gives you control in your own healing process.What else would you like to share?Remember, having a breast removed is not the end of the world! You can get a new rack out of it. I have an amazing pair of breasts now, better than what I had before! And whether you choose, or don\\'t choose breast reconstruction, just know that whatever state you live that you must LOVE yourself for who you are, and accept yourself, your whole body for what it is. We will always be changed for this experience called cancer. We are the walking examples of what it means to be beautiful, and to be a survivor. Live well. Live love. Be love. Excel. You are the embodiment of all women who have come before you, and you are all women who will come after you. You are the living example of excellence. And it is a pleasure to be in the company of so many beautiful women who are now my sisters who have excelled in the beauty of life. Comments: ',\n",

       " 'Gayle Shlafer is a 34-year-old wife and mother who lives in Gainesville, Florida. She is a technical writer and editor -- although her secret (or, not-so-secret anymore) ambition is to write novels. She is not ready to embark on her novel just yet, though, because breast cancer has put a lot of family plans on hold. But she considers this whole cancer thing a temporary set-back. And she is patiently waiting for a bit of normalcy to return to her world. Gayle is my neighbor. She is an inspiration. She is a survivor. And the words that follow are her own. When were you diagnosed with breast cancer? Feb. 25, 2006 How old were you at the time of diagnosis? 33. At first it was diagnosed as Stage I, but when it was discovered in the lymph nodes it became Stage II. Blech. Do you have a family history of breast cancer? No! I did get gene tested and I am not a carrier. *whew*How did you find out you had breast cancer? I was looking at myself naked in the mirror and saw the bottom of my breast looked flat. I poked it, and felt the lump. I scrounged around for my GYN\\'s list of \"how to do a self examination\" and followed the instructions. Called my GYN the next day (because I found it on a Sunday), went in Tuesday. The following Wednesday I had a mammogram and a sonogram, the day after that I had a surgery consult, the day after *that* I had surgery and the day after that I got my diagnosis (it was a Saturday). How did you tell your family members about your diagnosis? I told my hubby after I saw the GYN because he\\'d have to take time off for the surgery. It was Valentine\\'s day. What a wonderful gift, right? He actually answered the phone when the surgeon called with the diagnosis, so *he* had to tell *me.* I waited for the diagnosis before I told anyone else. I had to call my mom since she lives far away from me, and I made sure her roommate was home and she was sitting down. I started the conversation with \"It\\'s not fatal.\" I don\\'t think that helped much. What types of breast cancer treatment did you receive? First, a mastectomy and removal of lymph nodes. I finished my six rounds of chemo about a month ago, and will most likely start radiation in the next two weeks. How did you manage through breast cancer treatment? You know, it wasn\\'t too bad. I had one chemo treatment every three weeks, so the first week following I was tired, sometimes nauseous, picky appetite -- like pregnancy during the first trimester. The next two weeks would be fine and then I\\'d do it again. My doctor did not do any other type of visit other than chemo -- so I didn\\'t have to get blood drawn weekly and no check ups until my next appointment. I called if I wasn\\'t feeling well (I had a cough that wouldn\\'t go away for a while), but overall, the worst thing was the anticipation before chemo.What has been your worst breast cancer moment? After my mastectomy, I developed a possible infection, so the doctor had to treat my wound. Because of this, the wound drain (the tubes) didn\\'t work, so I had to stuff my wound with cotton and put a panty liner over it to keep it from draining on me. Changing the cotton and trying to judge when I needed to change the panty liner was absolutely disgusting. I had to work from home it was so gross.What has been your best breast cancer moment? I\\'m not wearing a wig, and my openness about what\\'s going on lets people ask me about it. They don\\'t feel like they have to be cautious around me, and I\\'d much rather answer their questions and spread some education around. It\\'s also a beacon to others going through treatment, so you can have solidarity with anyone you meet on the street.How do handle anxiety and worry related to breast cancer? I\\'m more worried about how much the needle pricks will hurt than I am about the cancer. As sad as it is, thousands of women before me have gone through it, and the treatment is what you do to stop it. I feel that my case will eventually help the thousands of women after me, so soon it will only be hundreds, then a handful, and then none. I\\'m part of the process to getting to that zero. I\\'m going through it so others won\\'t have to.How has breast cancer changed your life? I like to participate in community theater, Scottish dancing, and choreographed swordfighting. I can\\'t do any of those things this year because of surgeries, side effects, and treatment. Next year, though.What lessons have you learned through breast cancer?It\\'s great how supportive your family, friends, and people at work become. After people heard of my diagnosis, I had meals for weeks in my freezer and tons of movies and books to keep my mind occupied. We got gift certificates and offers of babysitting. It\\'s been really nice. Are you involved in any breast cancer support groups? Fundraisers? Organizations? No. I sometimes feel guilty that my treatments are going so well that I don\\'t want those who are suffering to ask me how I\\'m doing. But these things are on my list of things to do next year. What advice would you give someone newly diagnosed? Too many people tried to give me advice when I was diagnosed. It really drove me crazy, actually. I would let her know I was there, and was available to her if she should need it. If it was someone I saw often, I\\'d check in every so often to see how she was doing. I\\'d keep my advice to myself unless she asked for it. What advice would you give family members and friends of someone diagnosed with breast cancer? Take it a day at a time, because it will get better. Name any breast cancer related books or other resources you would recommend. The Internet is a wonderful general resource, but there\\'s nothing specifically that I used. What else would you like to share? One of the best things I did was set up an online journal so friends and family could track my progress without having to call me. There was one night when I was first diagnosed when I was on the phone for three hours answering the same questions from concerned family -- over and over and over again. Everyone is still allowed to call if they wish, but for just a quick update they can check online. It\\'s made it so much easier. Also, once my hair gets long enough, I\\'m going to have a shopping spree buying hair products and accessories. I\\'m looking forward to that. Comments: 1. Gayle,I\\'m so proud of you and your family. My prayers are always with you and my home is always open to you.Dale McClellan2. Reading this interview has a two-fold meaning for myself: 1) how much more awesome can Gayle be? 2) if you personally know Gayle &amp; know how she talks with her whole personality &amp; hands, will hear this incredible alive person through those words &amp; laugh &amp; giggle. Only Gayle could write about how she misses choreographed sword fights &amp; her Valentine\\'s Gift to her husband. Word to the Gayle &amp; there\\'s no higher word than Gayle.... ',\n",

Kim enjoys outdoor activities like camping as well as sewing, crafting, and carpentry projects. She is most at peace spending time with her family, working as a youth volunteer -- and raising awareness for breast cancer. It\\'s a interest she acquired just two years ago, compliments of a personal encounter with the disease that has taught her to let the little things go, to appreciate every sunrise, to make every moment matter.When were you diagnosed with breast cancer?July 23, 2004 -- six days before my 43rd birthdayHow old were you at the time of diagnosis? 43Do you have a family history of breast cancer? I have no family history of cancer. I was the first.How did you find out you had breast cancer? During my monthly exam, I noticed a difference in my breast, not a lump, but an area that was more firm than the rest of the breast.How did you tell your family members about your diagnosis? My family had gathered on July 24, 2004 to celebrate my mother\\'s birthday. Before the festivities, I told everyone I needed to talk with them. I explained that I had a biopsy of a lump found in my breast, which was positive for cancer. I shared with them my plans for surgery and told them what my surgeon told me -- \"This is not going to kill you.\" We discussed the treatment I had selected and made plans for my surgery and post-op recovery. After that I advised it was time to celebrate life, and we celebrated my mom\\'s 63rd birthday.What types of breast cancer treatment did you receive? I had a lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy on Aug 2, 2004. There was indication the cancer had reached the sentinel node. On Aug 9, I had a second surgery to remove axillary nodes for biopsy. All 11 nodes tested clear. In September, I started chemo -- Adriamycin, Cytoxan, and Taxotere -- with six treatments every three weeks apart. Each chemo cycle was followed by a Neulasta injection. I also received Procrit injections. After completing chemo, I moved on to radiation therapy -- 36 visits. I now am taking Tamoxifen on a daily basis.How did you manage through breast cancer treatment? Better than I thought I would. I found that research and medications made it much easier to tolerate chemo. The side effects were manageable. Radiation was my greatest fear, but with the technology, my surgery site was the target. The rest of my body was virtually unaffected.What has been your worst breast cancer moment? The confirmation of my fear. Hearing the words -- \"Your biopsy was positive for cancer.\"What has been your best breast cancer moment? Every day that I wake up and see the sunrise. This is confirmation that I am winning the battle.How do handle anxiety and worry related to breast cancer? Talking to sisters in survivorship and reading other survivor stories. Reading about the advances made each day.How has breast cancer changed your life? It seems cliche\\' but I don\\'t worry about the little things anymore. I try to make the most of each day and live. If the laundry or the dishes get put aside for a old John Wayne or Bing Crosby movie, oh well. The chores will be there tomorrow.What lessons have you learned through breast cancer? Thanks to research, the treatment will not kill you. Thanks to research, the treatments and care can be tailored to fit your lifestyle. Chemo does not have to be a debilitating treatment.Are you involved in any breast cancer support groups? No formal group. I found there are a lot of breast cancer survivors in my life. I have met many people who have been diagnosed after me, and we talk about treatments and living on after treatment. Making Strides Against Breast Cancer has become a priority.What advice would you give someone newly diagnosed? Talk to your physicians, talk with survivors, let your family help you, read all the information that is available through the American Cancer Society. Share your story, speak aloud about your fears. YOU ARE NOT ALONE, and there is tons of information available.What advice would you give family members and friends of someone diagnosed with breast cancer? The same I would give a total stranger.Name any breast cancer related books or other resources you would recommend.100 Questions and Answers about Breast Cancer. The book was an easy-to-read resource. It started with the basics, and included information on risk factors, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. It answers questions on how to cope with side effects and what changes to expect as a result of the treatments. There is an index listing web sites, addresses, and phone numbers for many, many, many resources. First and foremost -- American Cancer Society.What else would you like to share?I was and still am diligent in completing my monthly self exam, and I always make sure to remind my daughter to do her exam. It was through this diligence that my cancer was discovered early. Because it was discovered in its early stages, I am a survivor. The thought of recurrence will always be in my thoughts, but will not dominate my life. I know every day there are medical advances made -- because of the available research funds, which directly effect my chances of surviving. I will do my part as a survivor, to share my story, encourage awareness, and help raise the funds needed to keep the research going. Comments: ',\n",

A headline that reads, <EM>Pomegranate juice packs power to prevent cancer will bury a scientific -- yet more accurate -- headline. Catchy headlines grab readers, and readers buy products. But headlines can be misleading -- and pomegranate juice alone is not likely to have many health benefits.There are also issues with advertising and editorial content, according to Morris, who compares overall good nutrition to car maintenance. \"<SPAN class=articlez>Just like changing the air freshener in your car won\\'t prevent a breakdown if the car desperately needs a tune-up, adding one item of magical food to your diet won\\'t protect you from a breakdown either,\" he says and shares that a complete dietary makeover is what\\'s necessary for good health -- that and stress reduction, physical activity, emotional balance, and life fulfillment. A quick dose of pomegranate juice may not do the trick. But a steady, consistent dose of these items will.</SPAN> <FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2><FONT face=\"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" size=2>1.

       " 'Laura Berry is a 53-year-old wife and mother of three wonderful sons -- two are firefighters and one is a junior at the Air Force Academy. She also has two wonderful dauthers-in-law, the world\\'s most precious grandson, and a husband of 34 years who is her best friend. Laura is a breast cancer survivor -- who tells me her story is rather unremarkable. I think, like me, you will disagree.When were you diagnosed with breast cancer?I was diagnosed on the date of my 30th wedding anniversary on August 12, 2002, following a most wonderful second honeymoon/vacation. Although it was Stage 2 (it had traveled to my lymph nodes) fortunately I had \"classic\" menopausal breast cancer -- hormone positive, routinely treated with mastectomy, A&amp;C and Taxotere, then tamoxifen, no radiation required. At the same time, my 34-year-old friend with a 4-year-old daughter was dealing with a more invasive form and I felt a certain amount of guilt about that.How old were you at the time of diagnosis? I was 49 years old. Do you have a family history of breast cancer? No breast cancer anywhere in my family, which I understand is pretty common.How did you find out you had breast cancer? I had a lump. I went to my OB/GYN as soon as I found it and she said she thought it was a cyst but wanted me to have a mammogram to check it out. It turned out to be Stage 2 breast cancer.How did you tell your family members about your diagnosis?Very calmly and carefully. I told my husband first, of course and he was all about \"let\\'s beat this thing.\" My sons were 20, 19, and 17 at the time and used to seeing me in control of my life. As scared as I was, I did not want them to know that I was scared. I told them what I knew at the time and what I thought would happen and asked for their help and prayers. They were much more emotional than I thought they would be . . . but having lost my mother to another wretched form of cancer, I was sensitive to what they had seen their grandmother go through and what they obviously feared might be my demise. Once we shed our initial tears together, we never cried again.What types of breast cancer treatment did you receive? I had a radical mastectomy of my left breast and they also removed most of my lymph nodes on that side. Then A&amp;C for 3 treatments and Taxotere for 3 treatments. Then Tamoxifen. My doctor switched me to Aromasin as soon as all the great results came out from the studies.How did you manage through breast cancer treatment?I managed the same way everyone I know who has had breast cancer has managed. It is ironic how consistent we tend to be in our thought processes -- it is actually quite amazing. First we get our diagnosis. Then we do our research. We read, ask, go on line, and listen to our doctors and those who have gone before us. Then we steam full speed ahead with whatever is the determined course of action. Most of us are very aggressive, preferring to err on the side of caution -- take the breasts, give me the chemo, the radiation, whatever it takes to save my life ... and most of us believe we are saving our lives for our families, our children -- as if somehow putting those images out in front makes this more of a selfless act than a selfish one -- we are as maternal in this process as we are in giving birth or tending a sick child or aging loved one.What has been your worst breast cancer moment? That damned wig! Hot sweaty itchy -- no matter how much you spend on the perfect one, it is still ill-fitting and annoying, but I felt that I had to wear it because I still worked when I could through my treatment. I didn\\'t want the attention being bald would cause at work. If I had it to do over again, I would have been braver about showing the world what I was going throughWhat has been your best breast cancer moment? The entire experience was a most wonderful one for me personally. My husband shared feelings and strengths that I hadn\\'t known existed after 30 years of marriage. My boys were tender and sweet and helpful. My sisters rallied around me and protected me with their love and support, knowledge and devotion. Friends jumped into high gear offering meals, rides to the hospital, sent well wishes and stayed appropriately on the outskirts of the battle waiting for a chance to help. As a strong independent woman, I never realized how much one could rely and thrive on the love and kindness of those around us. The discomfort of surgery and chemo and reconstruction was so softened by the support of my family and friends.How do handle anxiety and worry related to breast cancer? Three and a half years after my last chemo treatment, I handle my fears as aggressively as I did my treatment. I regularly see my doctors and have my mammograms and scans. I have full confidence in all of them -- my ob/gyn, my internist, my oncologist, and they work together keeping each other up to date on what they may or may not find. My internist carefully monitors my heart for any post-chemo damage. My ob/gyn keeps an eye on possible side effects of tamoxifen (and now aromasin). I still see my oncologist every 6 months and she monitors blood work and tests. I am fully confident that if something arises, we will be fully prepared to deal with it. I have a peace about being in God\\'s hands.How has breast cancer changed your life? I am proud to be a survivor and honored when someone comes to me because they have been diagnosed with breast cancer and someone else suggested they talk to me. I am happy to share my experiences and stand by them as they go through theirs. An acquaintance just recently finished her radiation and her prognosis is very good. She wrote and thanked me for my support and guidance and said she was not sure she could have done it without me. Nonsense, I replied, breast cancer only attacks strong women OR breast cancer makes strong women -- whatever you prefer to believe, it is now your turn to pay it forward and help someone else. She agreed. This commitment to sisters in the battle has been the most rewarding part of my life for the past three years.What lessons have you learned through breast cancer? Life is short -- but we already knew that -- we just weren\\'t paying attention. Treat every day as special. The further away you get from your original diagnosis, the harder it is to keep yourself from slipping back into old ruts; bad habits. Use your relationships in this special club to help you remember how precious life is. Some tactical learnings: Once you are over 35, see your doctor regularly. If I hadn\\'t skipped a year, my breast cancer might have been discovered before it was at Stage 2. I was just too busy. I wish I had that to do over again. Now I am very preachy about mammograms and regular check-ups. If you work, make sure you have long term disability insurance. I never thought about it until I needed it and I didn\\'t have it.Are you involved in any breast cancer support groups? Fundraisers? Organizations? Fully support Susan G Komen with donations. Also American Cancer Society Walks. Participated in a quality of life study at UCF.What advice would you give someone newly diagnosed? Approach this as you would any other important event in your life. Do the research, listen to the experts and those who went before you. Then make the decision that you think is right for you. Be aggressive. Take the meds -- I am not talking about the treatment meds, I am talking about the coping meds. If you find that you are depressed or having anxiety during this difficult time, there are a zillion good meds that your doctor can prescribe to help you get through this adventure -- paxil, prozac, zoloft -- whatever he or she finds works best. And take the meds to help you sleep if you need them. Our trials seem larger than life in the wee hours of the night and so much more manageable in the light of day. Get your sleep.What advice would you give family members and friends of someone diagnosed with breast cancer? Be patient, supportive. No one knows what this is unless they have gone through it themselves. You have good days and bad days. You feel invincible and helpless. You go to hell and back again to kill this cancer and your body is the battlefield. Let the patient tell you what she needs and forgive her for not knowing. Take it one day at a time.Name any breast cancer related books or other resources you would recommend. The Breast Book by Dr. Love is really helpful when you are first diagnosed. Most of the resources I used were on the Internet -- MD Anderson, Sloan Kettering, American Cancer Society, HealthTalk, Susan G. Komen, etc.What else would you like to share? I would like to share how impressed I am with your blogs and your ability to share this adventure with others who love and admire you. Keep up the good work.You have no idea what it means to others. God Bless.Thank you, Laura! Comments: ',\n",
       " \"Leroy Sievers is a journalist who has spent a long career covering dozens of wars. He is accustomed to seeing other people die. But now, he is witnessing his own death. And on a recent NPR podcast, Sievers talks about how his doctors are trying to kill him by pumping poisonous chemotherapy drugs into his body. They haven't succeeded in killing him yet -- but they haven't cured him of cancer yet either.Blogger Dalene Entenmann wrote about Sievers on July 3, 2006, pointing readers in the direction of his NPR blog My Cancer. Since her posting, Sievers has continued to reflect on his battle and on October 3, he shared an essay about chemotherapy -- the same essay he reads on the NPR poscast. He tells readers and listeners that nowadays he reports for chemotherapy every three weeks and sits for five or six hours while drugs sail through his veins. The drugs just keep coming -- and a vacation from this drug treatment is nowhere in sight. It's become a way of life for a man who is simply buying time. It is a changed life -- one he would happily live without.Sievers, who thought he won the war against colon cancer and is now fighting brain and lung cancer, wakes each morning and feels pretty good -- as long as he stays in bed. When he gets up, the nausea begins and the tingling in his hands and feet begins. It takes him hours to get going, and eating is the last thing on his mind. But he takes pills that require food so giving up food is not an option. Sievers fights through debilitating fatigue each day, and no longer schedules anything in the morning. Mid-day -- when he feels pretty good -- is when he packs in appointments and meetings. But it all wipes him out and by the end of the day, the nausea and fatigue is back. One-quarter of one day, and Sievers is totally spent. And then each evening is a repeat of each morning.Sievers is trying a new drug and hopes it will shrink his tumor. He doesn't want to get his hopes up though, and he fears disappointment. Mostly, though, he wants his old life back. Even if just for a few days. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'A new line of pomegranate-based supplements, called Pomology, will be revealed this weekend at the 2006 Expo Trade Show in Baltimore, Maryland. According to leading nutritionists and fitness experts, \"each product contains a premium blend of proven ingredients that consumers can utilize for immediate relief and long-term health benefits.\" Target shoppers are those seeking a boost in heart health, prostate health, antioxidant health, joint health, and menopause. Pomegranates, known for anti-inflammatory effects and high levels of antioxidants, have been used medically for thousands of years and have recently been making headlines for their power to knock out all kinds of health problems, including cancer. Pomology was founded in 2005 by a team of nutritionists and athletic performance experts who created formulas that meet varying lifestyle needs. This product line is promoted as one of highest quality and efficacy.The information detailed above came directly from a press release.A few days ago, I wrote a post about Richard Morris of http://www.breadandmoney.com/ who argued that sensational press releases about miracle products and potions often land in the hands of the media who broadcast them to the public in a this-will-fix-all-your-problems fashion. Morris states that no one product will fix what ails us without the proper balance of a handful of other practices -- like relaxation, stress reduction, and exercise. It\\'s just not likely that Pomology supplements will result in \"immediate relief and long-term health benefits.\" It\\'s just not. Yet that is what we might gather from this press release. And unless we take on a full-scale lifestyle overhaul, what we gather from taking supplements such as these might just be a whole lot of nothing. Comments: 1. While I agree that in many cases vitamin supplements and especially weight loss products make claims that are outrageous, I think that the press release you point out is only pointing out the benefits that their ingredients may have been found to contain. I am a very health concious person and after checking out Pomology\\'s formulas, it looks like they have some ingredients that would help someone right away. And if all the research on antioxidants is correct, then there should be some long-term benefits.You may want all companies to not point out benefits that are actual or perceived, but when companies sell products, they are going to point out those benefits. And as a consumer, I want to know about them.',\n",
       " \"This is my port. It looks to me like a bottle cap sewn under the skin on my chest. My son Joey -- he is five years old --&nbsp; calls it my stone and his brother Danny -- he just turned three -- at one time thought everyone must have this same boo-boo. He would look for it, feel for it, hunt for it. But mine is the only port he could actually locate and now that he's getting older, he is not so concerned with it anymore.My concern about the port is that everyone who needs chemotherapy should have one. It's the alternative to receiving IV sticks in the arms and hands and except for one quick stick that can sting -- I use a 5% lidocaine numbing cream prior to my infusion and with this miracle lotion, I don't feel a thing -- it is quick and painless. My port is a one-stop shop. Once accessed, blood can be drawn, drugs and fluids can be infused, shots can be injected, and at the end of treatment, an injection of blood thinner keeps the line clear and clean. The line attached to the port underneath my skin travels into large veins in a direct and efficient manner. While hospitalized for chemo-induced fever and low blood counts, I received antibiotics and a blood transfusion through this method. There was one stick when I was admitted and for my five-day stay, I never had to be poked again.My port, called Infuse-a-PortÂ®, was implanted during a minor outpatient surgery with use of a local anesthesia and it was ready for use immediately after the procedure. My port has been used for 16 months now and will no longer be necessary at the end of July -- this is when the last drops of Herceptin will sail through my veins. Then I get to decide whether to keep my port or have it removed. It can stay for many years as long as it is flushed once each month. The superstitious part of me thinks I should keep it for future use -- if necessary -- and the rational part of me thinks I need to get rid of this bottle cap because I may never need it again. Regardless, I love my port. It has eased the discomfort of chemotherapy and for that, I am grateful. Comments: 1. My doctor told me I could have my port removed, but I actually wanted relief for a while, from anything medical and did also feel I should wait a respectable time. Unfortunately, that was a wise decision. A few months after I needed more treatment. I would suggest that you keep it for a few months or a year, then let it go ! Something to think about is, how bad are your veins and how comfortable you are, if the port removed, then needs to be placed again. Each person deals with this differently. No matter what, we have no definite way of knowing in advance of what we need to do. Its a chance we take, that works differently for each \\x10persons pysch.2. I'm so glad I had my port implanted about a year and a half ago. It was very difficult getting a vein so frequently and now all the pain and anxiety are gone. I too use a numbing agent an hour before it's accessed and don't feel anything during the procedure. It's one less problem to think about. 3. About 5 minutes before I read this my 6 year old son asked me how long he will keep his port in. My husband and I just discussed this last night and we want him to keep it for as long as practical. His cancer is likely to recur (again) and he will need his port accessed at least every 3 months for tests. I have to admit - there is a great deal of superstition as well...4. The surgeon tried unsuccessfully to insert a port before I was to begin chemo. Luckily, I had a PICC line inserted in my arm, which was nice but not as efficient as a port (needs to be flushed more often), got clogged once and had to be removed and another inserted. But I am of the type that once my cancer was in remission, I had it removed right away.I hope that you make the decision about your port that is right for you.\",\n",
       " \"Studies exist that link acid-reflux conditions to cancer of the larynx -- or voice box -- but authors of a new study say they all suffer shortcomings in methodology. The new study, published in the American Journal of Medicine, was intended to make up for these shortcomings by comparing 96 men and women with laryngeal cancer to a group of adults without the disease. All participants were matched by age, gender, and ethnicity -- three of the most important risk factors for this cancer. Overall, the study found people with GERD -- gastroesophageal reflux disease -- were twice as likely to develop laryngeal cancer, compared to those without the condition. GERD has long been considered a possible risk factor for this cancer, mostly because GERD is common among people with the cancer. More definitive studies are on the horizon.GERD, which occurs when the muscle of the bottom of the esophagus fails to close properly, allowing stomach acids to leak into the esophagus, is also linked to esophageal cancer. Comments: 1. Approximately 10 percent of GERD patients develop Barrett's esophagus. A middle-aged person with BE for 20 years or more has a 10 to 20 percent lifetime risk of developing esophageal cancer, which is similar to the risk of lung cancer among heavy smokers or of liver cancer among chronic hepatitis-B virus carriers. 2. would a person suffering from a hiatal hernia also be high risk for cancer of the throat?\",\n",
       " 'When a question or concern or worry related to breast cancer pops into my head, I typically find myself parked in front of my computer in search of instant answers, instant comfort, instant wisdom. There are several different websites I consult -- each one different from the others, each one complementing the others. They are my reference tools, my handbooks, my encyclopedias. They offer me a clear picture of a confusing, cloudy disease. And here they are -- seven super websites that have been become staples in my life.The Cancer BlogIf you are reading this post, then you know how to reach The Cancer Blog. There\\'s nothing like it for timely cancer-related news, the latest in cancer research and information, connections to cancer survivors everywhere, and general health tips and techniques. Written by breast cancer survivors who have traveled their own bumpy cancer roads, each post -- there are several per day -- published on The Cancer Blog is fresh, insightful, and full of personal passion.My Breast Cancer NetworkHealth Central is a major health stop on the information superhighway. Consisting of 30 different health networks -- featuring topics such as allergies, anxiety, diabetes, and menopause -- the network that helps me most is My Breast Cancer Network. With three major navigation tools -- find, manage, and connect -- this network helps breast cancer survivors, their partners, and their loved ones locate answers to questions, find direction in managing their diseases, and reach an on-line community of medical experts and expert patients. It\\'s the balance between medical opinion and patient experience that makes this site an important bookmark.Young Survival CoalitionMost diagnoses of breast cancer happen for women over the age of 50. But breast cancer does strike young women -- like me -- who are affected in distinct ways by this disease. Tumors in young women tend to more aggressive, menopause is often triggered in young women who experience chemotherapy, and concerns about the safety of pregnancy after breast cancer can cause anxiety for young women. The Young Survival Coalition (YSC) addresses the unique considerations facing young women with breast cancer. And the YSC website was one of the first sites I stumbled upon after my breast cancer diagnosis. I spent most of my time reading posts on the bulletin board where I could gather advice from women traveling my same road. The American Cancer SocietyFor solid research-based facts and figures and statistics, I visit the American Cancer Society website where I can navigate through all sorts of cancer material and can find out just about anything I need to know about breast cancer. Just yesterday, I searched for information on breast cancer incidences in men. I found out that in 2006, 1,700 men will be diagnosed with this disease. And I learned that 100 times more women than men will be diagnosed in this same year.The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation It\\'s the destination of many fundraising dollars, and it\\'s a source of valuable information on innovative research and community outreach programs. It\\'s The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation -- and it caters to patients, survivors, and co-survivors who seek to increase their knowledge about breast cancer. Known for an invigorating 5K walk -- Race for the Cure -- and a push-yourself-to-the-limit 3-Day, 60-mile walk -- The Breast Cancer 3-Day -- Susan G. Komen covers it all.Dr. Susan Love Research FoundationI was told by the surgeon who performed my biopsy and delivered my diagnosis that Dr. Susan Love\\'s Breast Book was the bible for breast cancer patients and survivors. He was right. For me, a quick flip through my book was all it took to arrive at specific and easy-to-understand answers to my anxiety-producing questions. When I didn\\'t know what to expect from chemotherapy, Dr. Love told me. When I wanted statistics about my chances at survival, Dr. Love told me. And when I wasn\\'t sure what my HER2 positive status meant, Dr. Love told me. And while my book is still within reach -- two years after my sister bought it for me -- I often turn to Dr. Love\\'s website for more recent information and developments.BreastCancer.orgBreastCancer.org offers short snippets of information that simply make sense. Anything I\\'ve ever wondered about, I\\'ve found on this site. Recently, someone asked me if certain bras were linked to breast cancer. I had never heard of any connection but wanted to research the possibility. I visited this site and after a quick search this is what I found:Question: Can you get breast cancer from things you do to your breasts, like wearing a bra all the time, or when your partner caresses them?Answer: No, you cannot get breast cancer from these things.

       " \"In July 2005, Amy Wilson was diagnosed with breast cancer. In the months that followed, Amy endured a lumpectomy, a mastectomy, reconstruction, and chemotherapy. In January 2006, Amy's treatment ended. And she set off on a journey of survivorship. In August 2006, Amy found out her cancer had spread to her brain and lungs. Her doctors gave her two to 12 months to live. On Thursday, October 5, 2006, Amy died. She was 35 years old.Amy became my friend shortly after her original diagnosis and eight months after my own breast cancer diagnosis. A mutual friend brought us together and for a little more than one year, we shared a rich connection, cemented in shared struggles and victories. Through phone conversations and e-mail exchanges and cards and gifts sent through the mail, Amy and I shared a special friendship. But I never looked Amy in the eye, never offered her a hug, never met her husband and children. I knew her only from a distance. Still, our partnership was powerful. It was comforting. And sadly, it is over.Our same mutual friend called me Friday morning to tell me Amy had passed away -- a mere 15 months after her battle began, three months shy of the end-of-treatment anniversary she happily anticipated, five years from the age of 40 -- the age she had determined would mark her first true survivor milestone.I miss Amy. I miss the pieces of hope that vanished with her death. I miss that I never met her, never hugged her, never said goodbye. Amy, whose journey was chronicled in her local Ohio newspaper, is survived by her husband, her two children -- Luke, age five and Ella, age two -- and among others, her mother, who is currently fighting her own breast cancer battle. Comments: 1. Jackie, I don't know how you do this day after day - write for this blog, keep your own spirits up, but I thank-you for the sense of community and hope that you still manage to inspire. My condolences to the Wilson family.2. Jackie, I read your blogs everyday! I too live in Florida and have two young childrena nd am abaout to begin my journey. I hope I can be as positive and as strong as you. Your strength and knowledge radiate through your writing and I thank you!!!It is so tragic to read about Amy Wilson. How did it spread to her lungs and brain? My thoughts and prayers are with the Wilson family.\",\n",
       " 'Kara Dawson is a breast cancer survivor. She has not been diagnosed herself -- although the fear of diagnosis is her constant companion. She instead lived as a child with the disease her mother battled. And she now lives in the aftermath of breast cancer following the death of her mom. Kara was just 12 years old when her mom was diagnosed with breast cancer -- the disease that would take her life just a few years later. For 22 years, Kara has been surviving the loss of her mom. For 22 years, Kara has been surviving breast cancer. Now 37 years old, Kara has become a busy mom herself. She shares her world with two wonderful sons -- ages five and three -- and an amazing husband, a Great Dane, a love of athletics and the out-of-doors, and a career as a professor at the University of Florida.Kara is a woman of great strength, courage, faith, and inspiration. She has helped power me through my own breast cancer journey -- and I believe her own personal brush with the disease is what makes her such a supportive, attentive, encouraging friend. She helps me fight for my life -- as she fights the curse of family history for her own life.How old were you when your mom was diagnosed with breast cancer? 12 years oldHow old was your mom? 36 years oldHow did you learn that your mom had breast cancer? I don\\'t even remember. My dad and mom were high school sweethearts so I grew up in the same town as my grandparents and great-grandparents. I knew my family was acting strangely and that mom was going to the doctor a lot but my brothers (ages 10, 8 and 6) and I didn\\'t know what was happening. I guess I first knew something was wrong when she came home from the doctor and vomited for 3 straight days. Chemotherapy is still horrible but I think it has come a long way since the mid 80s. My mom\\'s sister got breast cancer five years ago and she went to work the day after her treatments which was unbelievable to me.What did breast cancer mean to you at the time of her diagnosis? Something terrible; my dad\\'s mom died of cancer a few years before my mom was diagnosed so I had already seen what it could do to a person I love dearly.What does breast cancer mean to you now? In my teens I had nightmares about going through what my mom went through. It was really, really terrible to watch especially as an adolescent. I threw myself into high school then college academics and athletics and didn\\'t talk about it much. In my 20s I assumed I would die of breast cancer and continued to use this as a right to be selfish. I played in volleyball tournaments almost every weekend, worked really hard to earn my Ph.D. before I turned 30 and essentially filled my days with things for me. In my 30s I now recognize that I may or may not get breast cancer and that fear of the disease filled me with selfishness. I started a family, started thinking outside myself and hopefully am doing small things to make the world a little bit better.What treatments did your mom receive? I don\\'t remember everything but she received chemotherapy and radiation and had surgery to remove at least one of her breasts. I learned recently that when mom and dad learned the treatment was not working she participated in an experimental study with a new drug. Obviously, it didn\\'t help her but I like to think she has helped others who fought the disease in later years.What visual memories do you have of breast cancer? I remember her fake breast. They just stuffed a fake one in her bra at that time. There was not any reconstructive surgery (at least not for her). I remember her trying to find a swimsuit to wear. (She was very athletic and outdoorsy too). I remember having close friends come over while she lay on the couch with all the blinds closed. Some of these people are still my close friends and I know they remember it too. I remember her getting really fat from the treatments and being very upset about it. I remember her getting really super skinny near the end. How did your mom cope with breast cancer? I have no idea. Now that I am a mom, I really don\\'t know. I know she had a strong faith in the Lord long before this disease hit so that had to be what got her through. I don\\'t know how my dad coped either and after all these years I know he hasn\\'t recovered.How did the disease affect the entire family? It still does. My life and my family would be so different if she was still alive. I was recently recognized at a high school banquet and I couldn\\'t even give a speech because my dad, my brothers, my mom\\'s mom, my mom\\'s brother and sister and my close high school friends were in the audience. The memories came flooding back, and I choked up. Every holiday has a hole; every trip home has a hole, every special moment has someone missing. Even so, I have been amazingly blessed since the time of my mom\\'s death. I know the Lord is watching out for me and that some day I will learn why this happened to our family.What were your hopes and fears for your mom? I didn\\'t have any. I was too consumed with me as is probably typical of a preteen/teen.What are your hopes and fears for yourself? I don\\'t really have time for either but my one hope is to be a good mom for my boys so if I do leave them early they have awesome memories of me. My one fear is definitely leaving them early. Every day is a blessing so I try to make the most of it.How long was your mom\\'s battle?Two to three years.How did you realize her battle was nearing an end? Mom went into the hospital and I wasn\\'t allowed to see her. I have mixed feelings about this now but I still remember what my dad\\'s mom looked like at 75 pounds so I guess I am glad I don\\'t have that memory of my Mom.Describe the end. I remember being at school and having to fill out some kind of survey in homeroom. It asked about your parents and I marked deceased for my mom. It was weird but I had a feeling she was gone. I remember our pastor being at home after school THAT DAY. I knew what had happened but I didn\\'t talk to anyone. I snuck in the back door, got my swimming stuff and walked to practice. I didn\\'t say a word to anyone at practice but I cried underwater the entire time. I just knew what had happened but I didn\\'t want to hear it. My coaches and teammates caught on and a couple of teammates walked me home.Describe life without your mom. I wish she was here but she really shaped a lot of who I am now. In particular, I remember her teaching me to value everyone, to be on time for things, to be responsible and to love life. She tried to teach me to be creative and artistic too but that didn\\'t work :)How has your mom\\'s battle affected your own pursuit of health? Well, I have been having mammograms since age 22. I also have four check ups a year -- a mammogram, MRI and two doctor exams. I am not fond of doctor offices but it is something I need to do for myself and my family. I don\\'t consider my goal of healthy living related to my Mom\\'s disease but maybe it is.What would you say to other individuals whose moms are battling breast cancer? Communicate, communicate, communicate. That is one thing that never happened in my household and, in retrospect, I recognize it is an important component of the process.What else would you like to share? I learned through this experience that everyone is replaceable except mommy and daddy. If I die tomorrow my friends will go on and remember me fondly, my colleagues at work will hire someone new who will do just as well if not better than me but my boys will be changed forever. So, I guess I want everyone to know their job at home is the most important even if society doesn\\'t make us feel that way. And, for those who find a good cry therapeutic I recommend the book Motherless Daughters. Comments: 1. I thought my tears had finally dried up. I can feel for Kara on so many levels. Having lost my own mother in February to gallbladder cancer, being diagnosed myself with breast cancer 2 months later. Having 2 pre/teen aged daughters. I have been so worried about how all of this is affecting them and your comments offer me some valuable insight, Thank-you. I know how painful my moms death was/is for me and I have a hard time thinking about how tough it must have been for you as a child. I can imagine my youngest reacting the same - going to swim class, acting stoic, falling apart at the same time. This is not something a child should have to contend with. Communication IS key, we can\\'t replace our parents, and yes, a good cry is highly therapeutic. I wish Kara luck in her journey.2. investigate before you donate, before funding ANY! charity.

Kara was my best friend in high school, and our recollections of the day her mom died are a little different. We lived half a block away, and I picked her up to walk to the pool for a swimmeet. Her normal smile was absent, and when I asked, she simply looked at the ground and told me, \"My mom died.\" The only reason I wish to tell the story as I remember is because, unbelievably, she swam that night\\'s meet just like any other, strong and hard. She had more courage in her pinky than I would ever have in my entire being, and to this day, that is the way that I will always think of her. Reading her story made me cry unlike I have in many, many years, for the obvious reasons, but mostly because I never realized how much pain she was in. You see, Kara never let it show. She just marched on forward, harder and stronger every day.To see her call herself \"selfish\" is amazing to me, because in all the time I\\'ve known Kara, I have been in awe of her selflessness and dedication to her family. When her mom passed, she had to become the mom for her family. While the rest of us liked boys, did our homework and worried about Friday nights, Kara had to make dinners, help with homework, do the laundry and keep the house clean. And not once, did I ever hear her complain... not once. I\\'ve always thought of Kara\\'s incredible work ethic, dedication to sports and academia, and pursuit of personal perfection as a tribute to her mother and the kind of person that her mother would have wanted her to be. And although I didn\\'t know her mom for very long, I know she would be so proud of her daughter and what she has done with her life. Not only has she brought two beautiful little boys into the world, she has been an incredible teacher, an outstanding role model to hundreds of athletes &amp; students, and she has time and time again, been a friend, like no other, to many, many people. You are truly an inspiration Kara. Thank you for finally sharing your story.4. Hi, Kara,I was 50 when I lost my mom to breast cancer (or, more technically, chemotherapy-related pneumonia). She was 79. It doesn\\'t get any easier just because you\\'re older.My mother had infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast. It didn\\'t for a lump and it didn\\'t show up on her mammogram. It was diagnosed when it metastasized into her hip.My mother was a good person. Her primary fault was always not admitting to how hard things were for her. She didn\\'t take pain meds until the metastases were degenerating her spine, and then it was because the doctor told her she had to. She would never tell someone if she was in pain, and one could never tell by her expressions or behavior. The only time I heard her speak about her pain was when very calmly said, one time, \"Bone cancer is hell. It really is.\" She stayed busy, stayed connected to others, continued her activities and hobbies until she literally could no longer move on her own. She cooked from her wheelchair because she wanted to when a tumor in her femur burst and she could no longer engage in weight bearing. She rejected Meals on Wheels. I have the quilt she was working on when she passed away. One day, when I can look at it w/o getting teary, I may finish it for her. I told her I would. The oncologist gave her an estimated 2 years w/ tx from time of dx, and she lived a little more than 3 1/2.Her goal was to beat it. In the end, I told her to just let go and step out of her body. She said, \"I\\'m going to beat it,\" and I told you, \"You already did. You kicked it\\'s butt.\" And she passed away. 5. I can commend the strength found in this story. I am 48 years old and lost my mother on July 4th and 5-1/2 years of battling breast cancer which spread to the bones and liver. She was so brave and strong but I still cry uncontrollably and miss her more than words can say. I feel robbed that this was \"our time\" with my children almost grown and she retired. She was such a beautiful and giving person and I miss her so very much. We need to do more to find a cure for this dreadful disease. 6. What an emotional roller coaster of a story. Reading this took me back to my own childhood and the pain and lonliness I felt after losing my own mother to breast cancer when I was just 6 years old. Nothing was done to help her other than \\'rest\\' because the survival rate then was practically zero. Kara had the loving support of her family unlike me who had a few counseling sessions and an unsympathetic, controlling, overbearing and abusive father who married and divorced 3 more times. I wish my mother were here but I kept her with me, in my heart, always and graduated college, stayed married to my college sweetheart and had 5 beautiful children. She missed all of this but I knew I had to overcome the loss of unconditional love when she died and her memory proved a strong will in me to succeed in life. Something my family never thought I could accomplish. Her spirit lives on...through me and through her wonderful grandchildren. I know she watches over us, always. This story is a tear jerker and there are many of us out there...still longing for our mothers, in silence, our mourning will never end. A silent sisterhood of strength, loss and survival.',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t know what was coming when I plopped myself down in the waiting room of an Ear, Nose, and Throat clinic yesterday -- which is a good thing. Had I known what doctors would do to me, I may have run the other way. I may have learned to live with the pain I was experiencing each time I swallowed food. But I waited patiently, aware that doctors would \"scope\" my esophagus, mildly certain the procedure could be uncomfortable, completely unprepared for the full \"scope\" experience.I swallowed a pill on Friday night -- not even a whole pill, just a half of one pill -- and it hurt when it went down my throat. I\\'ve had the feeling before, a sensation like the pill got stuck, but the discomfort has always gone away within a few hours. This time, it lasted. It hurt to swallow saliva. It hurt to swallow food. It just hurt. So after three days, I took myself to the clinic -- with the subtle worry that cancer was settling in my esophagus. I know rationally that every ache and pain I experience is not cancer. But I\\'ve had cancer. And so I constantly battle a nagging fear lodged deep in my head that reminds me cancer is always a possibility, that cancer is often a shocking outcome of a routine little test for a simple little health concern.I do not have cancer. I do not have cancer of the throat, voice box, esophagus, or stomach. That\\'s the good news. The scope revealed -- via a tiny camera that traveled through my body -- nothing but healthy tissue. That makes me happy. The test did not make me happy. I now know the scope is a long, thin tube that enters the body through one nostril. Ouch. It travels into the throat. Ouch. The patient swallows when it reaches the throat to assist in maneuvering it down further. Ouch. The scope then makes its way past the voice box, though the esophagus, and into the stomach. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. The travels are all displayed on a monitor, and I actually got a glimpse of these body parts -- during the split second when I was able to control my gagging, loosen my grip on the arms of the exam chair, and open my clinched eyes. So I saw for myself that everything looks healthy -- just before the tube was pulled right back through all these parts, leaving me with a very sore throat.Now that I am home and have talked with a few people, I hear that some patients are unconscious for this procedure. They are completely unaware of the horrors of the scope. I got a few sprays to numb my nose and throat and drank a thick cocktail of lidocaine -- but I did not get the luxury of unconsciousness. And in the end that is okay. I got to see what was happening. I got to hear the doctor\\'s revelation that nothing major is wrong. I got to witness the wonder of medical technology. I got to prove to myself that I can handle a little discomfort in exchange for a clean bill of health. And I got to learn that I have a bit of acid reflux. And now I have to squash that nagging fear that reminds me of the literature out there suggesting a link between acid reflux and cancer. Comments: ',\n",

Wendy has also made a tour with stage II breast cancer. Since 2001, she has been surviving this disease.When were you diagnosed with breast cancer?In April of 2001How old were you at the time of diagnosis?39Do you have a family history of breast cancer?My maternal grandmother had breast cancer in the 60s, before there was chemotherapy. She had horrible, disfiguring surgery, and the cancer came back a few years later and killed her.How did you find out you had breast cancer?I noticed a lump in my breast and mentioned it to my doctor.How did you tell your family members about your diagnosis?I am not one to sugarcoat things. I got all the information I could get on the type of cancer and the treatment I\\'d have, then I called to tell them.What types of breast cancer treatment did you receive?I had a modified radical mastectomy with reconstruction, followed by two rounds of chemotherapy -- that took 8-months. First, there was Adriamycin and Cytoxan. Then, I was on a clinical trial for Taxotere. I have been taking Tamoxifen for 5 years now.How did you manage through breast cancer treatment?I can\\'t say it was easy, but it was manageable. You just have to reduce the number of things you do every day, be realistic about going to work, working out, seeing friends. I worked through the whole treatment, except for when I was too sick.What has been your worst breast cancer moment?My worst moment didn\\'t even have to do with me. One of my good friends who was just at the five-year clear mark was re-diagnosed with cancer, right before her wedding. I think that was the first time I realized how vulnerable I was (she\\'s fine -- and got married bald!).What has been your best breast cancer moment?Finishing chemo was big. The nurses gave me a graduation certificate. And hitting the 5-year mark was special, too.How do handle anxiety and worry related to breast cancer?I didn\\'t have much anxiety or worry. I focused on having all the information I could find. I believe fear comes from lack of knowledge, and the last thing I am is fear-based.How has breast cancer changed your life?My life is much better. My outlook is more positive, more focused on the big things. A crisis really forces you to realize what\\'s important and what\\'s not. I have also gotten the biggest opportunities because out of being a survivor (riding across country in the 2003 Tour of Hope with Lance Armstrong, being involved with the Lance Armstrong Foundation, etc.).Are you involved in any breast cancer support groups? Fundraisers? Organizations?I am a major fundraiser for the Lance Armstrong Foundation and for the Tour of Hope. I also do a lot of speaking about survivorship and cancer issues.What advice would you give someone newly diagnosed?Get all the information you can. Be your own advocate in health care. You have to be aggressive about options, education, everything. And take things one at a time, so it\\'s not so overwhelming.What advice would you give family members and friends of someone diagnosed with breast cancer?Offer specific help, not just \"call me if you need anything.\" They won\\'t call. Say \"I\\'ll bring your family dinner every Tuesday for a month\" or \"I\\'ll drive you to your chemo appointment.\" And don\\'t NOT talk about it. Ask questions, talk about it, use it as a learning experience for you too.Name any breast cancer related books or other resources you would recommend.Rosie O\\'Donnell\\'s book on breast cancer is the best I\\'ve read.

       " \"It's no secret exercise is beneficial for just about everyone. So it should come as no surprise that researchers reported Monday that moderate, regular exercise can help women combat some of the side effects of breast cancer radiation treatment.Researchers found that breast cancer patients who walked briskly 20 to 45 minutes three to five times per week during treatment maintained healthy blood cells. Red blood cells and hemoglobin -- which carry oxygen -- often suffer during radiation treatment. And those who do not exercise lose significant oxygen capacity.This study, published in the journal Cancer, is the first to look into the effect of exercise during breast cancer radiation treatment. It rounds out research that already shows exercise can help prevent breast cancer and can also help women recover from the disease. Comments: 1. It's no surprise that exercise goes well with radiation treatment. I've found many of my hypnotherapy clients who are also getting radiation combine exercise with positive self talk for maximum effect. I have helped several clients create their own exercise recordings complete with a chorus of affirmations in their own voice. There's something very powerful about hearing yourself say that you are thriving as you prove it to yourself with exercise. Exercise is physical proof for your subconscious that you are thriving and healing and all your affirmations are coming true. Keep on exercising!!!! \",\n",

       " 'In the United States, mammograms are not recommended for women under the age of 40. Other then an annual check-up and a monthly self breast exam, young women with no family history of breast cancer have no medical tools available for preventing and detecting the disease. But no woman is immune to this disease -- and being female is the single most important risk factor for diagnosis. And young women do get breast cancer. I did. And so did Sharon Rutherford, a 36-year-old Ulster woman who was diagnosed in December.Rutherford is urging health officials to lower the age for screening in Northern Ireland -- where routine breast screening programs are reserved for women between the ages of 50 and 64. Rutherford says this is inadequate as there is an \"absolutely chronic\" number of younger women suffering from breast cancer.Although there is a reduced-age screening program that monitors women beginning at age 40, Rutherford would like to see the screening age reduced to 30. Until then, she is educating women about how they can be vigilant about their own care. She urges women to report to doctors anything that just doesn\\'t feel right. And because doctors may excuse symptoms because women are \"too young\" for breast cancer -- that\\'s what doctors told her -- women must aggressively pursue medical care. Rutherford kept pursuing the thickening she felt in her breast -- and eventually she was referred for screening.Rutherford has had a partial mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation treatment. And she is now active in the Ulster Cancer Foundation\\'s new support group -- specifically for women under the age of 40. Comments: 1. The reason that mammograms are not recommended for women under 40 has nothing to do with the lower risk for women under 40. It has to do with the simple reality that in women under 40, breast tissue is generally (read: almost always) too dense for current mammogram technology to resolve cancer. This isn\\'t a policy issue, it\\'s a technology issue. We need better radiological and other diagnostic tools generally available.',\n",

       " 'There is something about reading stories about other cancer survivors that helps me in moments of despair. Sometimes I look to the blogs that I read regularly -- blogs that capture the essence of realities that are not my own -- and I feel somehow comforted. I gain perspective and can remove myself a bit from my own turmoil. I gather strength and hope from others who struggle like me. I absorb the words written in these journals and see the photos of real people with real struggles and the big picture becomes clear to me -- breast cancer is widespread and far-reaching. And because of this, I have a lot of company of my path of uncertainty. This is what soothes me.Books help me too -- the kind of books with little snippets of advice and wisdom from other survivors. Like Hope Lives! The After Breast Cancer Treatment Survival Handbook. My favorite chapter is about recurrence. There are passages from women who have had breast cancer two and three times and these strong women remind me that I if necessary, I can fight again and again and again. This book is humbling, sobering, and powerful. The voices that inhabit the pages put a bounce in my step and peace in my head. Hope does in fact live. Comments: ',\n",
       " \"There is a lot of breast cancer awareness out there. Some believe it's too much. Some say it's overboard. Some wish breast cancer could share some of the spotlight with all the other cancers -- those struggling for a little more funding, a little more research, a little more air time. Is it possible there could be more awareness for the disease that corners the market on all things pink? Yes. It's possible. And it's necessary too.As long as women are dying of breast cancer -- in 2006, breast cancer will kill about 40,000 women in the United States -- there is cause for more awareness. And each October -- Breast Cancer Awareness Month -- breast cancer information bombards us all. Annoying as it may seem, the reminders that flow from breast cancer campaigns are truly critical. Reminders about self exams and mammograms and early detection and risk factors and new developments can save lives. They do save lives. And while we should all hope other cancers -- that are just as serious, just as widespread, just as life-threatening -- one day receive the attention they deserve, we should still not pass on opportunities to hop on the breast cancer bandwagon. There is still a lot of road to cover, a lot of progress to be made.Hopefully, breast cancer awareness stays on the radar. Hopefully, reminders continue to keep charging at us. Day after day. October after October. Until breast cancer is a thing of the past. Comments: 1. Many of the methods of treatment for breast cancer are NOT for breast cancer alone but will benefit those who have many other types of cancer. Chemotherapy is a good example. Radiation is another. Many, many types of cancer use both not to mention surgery. There is a commonality with all cancers and a good bit of the attention that breast cancer gets will benefit us all. 2. There's no doubt that reminders save lives, and of course that's great. It's not that I'm annoyed by reminders of breast cancer in October -- the scar on my chest reminds me every day. It's corporations making money from a disease that disturbs me. Campbell's soup donating a measly 3.5 cents per can when some orders from major market chains have doubled really makes me not want to eat soup. It's showing picture after picture of the brave Woman in Pink, who is moving forward with a smile on her face, that annoys me, when the women I know spend a lot more time bald, with their head in a toilet, sometimes after an amputation, too often with permanent disability, and a chance of death when it's all through. It's WONDERFUL that many women are strong enough to keep their daily lives going throughout treatment. Perhaps just as many lose their jobs and their incomes. Pink has connotations of femininity and prettiness. There's nothing pink about breast cancer. 3. Had it not been for all of the pink hype of Breast Cancer Awareness month I wouldn't have gone for my first mammogram. I went through a few weeks of confusion over test results and it was very scarey. I came out of it healthy and with a baseline mammogram that could save my life down the road. Now my doctor has something to compare my mammogram to next year...and the year after that.As long as women and men are getting the message let the pink ribbons fly. \",\n",
       " 'Dr. Chandra Belani, Professor of Medicine and Oncology at the University of Pittsburg Cancer Institute, is a leader in the study of lung cancer. During a podcast interview, Belani shares some thoughts on the state of lung cancer -- currently the most common cause of cancer death in the United States.Belani reveals that progress in the areas of lung cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment can best be described as modest. There has been some progress -- and there are many on-going studies in these areas -- but there are no major breakthrough stories. Belani says there has been modest progress in diagnosis with the use of CT scans and PET scans -- and a combination of the two. There has been modest progress in chemotherapy treatment options. There has been no significant advance in detection -- and prevention is mostly in the hands of each individual since 90 percent of lung cancer cases are related to smoking.Belani shares that true achievement would come with the discovery of a biomarker to detect lung cancer early and to lower overall mortality rates. He would also like to determine why he is seeing an increase in lung cancer cases among non-smokers.The bar is being raised, says Belani. But it\\'s slow going. Comments: 1. Lung cancer is not my area, but I have noticed a number of studies indicating that three nutrients that affect prostate cancer also seem to affect lung cancer, though the data are not conclusive.The three nutrients are: lycopene, selenium (for those who are deficient) and vitamin E. You can find abstracts of relevant studies by going to www.pubmed.gov and searching for \"lung cancer AND lycopene\", etc.While the data are not conclusive, if I were a smoker, I would be making sure I was getting enough of these nutrients and watching for news about them and lung cancer. (I\\'m a survivor, not a medical professional, so check these out for yourself.)Jim Waldenfels 2. I wish to thank Jim W., for his comments. Currently my brother in law is receiving radiation/chemo for lung cancer. I am following up with your input.Molly ',\n",
       " 'Jennifer Matherly is a 27-year-old wife, mother, daughter, sister, insurance broker, student, and friend. She is also a breast cancer survivor. Jennifer, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, enjoys golfing, watching football, and spending time with friends and family. She doesn\\'t have much free time lately -- but when she finds moments all to herself, she tends to her hobbies which include cross-stitching and working on her blog.Jennifer\\'s blog began as a story about her journey to motherhood. It turned into a story about her journey with breast cancer. It\\'s an inspiring read, full of trials and triumphs. It\\'s a testament to her strength and courage and sheer determination. It\\'s a story of survivorship -- a little something like what follows.When were you diagnosed with breast cancer? I was diagnosed on September 23, 2005. How old were you at the time of diagnosis? I was 26 years old. Do you have a family history of breast cancer? I have no family history of breast cancer.How did you find out you had breast cancer? I found a lump in my breast and first went to my OB/GYN to get it checked out. They did a breast ultrasound which was not reassuring and I was referred to a breast surgeon. My surgeon did a Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) in the office and scheduled my for an excisional biopsy to remove the lump. My results from the FNA came back benign and I stopped worrying. A couple weeks later I had the surgical biopsy. My surgeon called me at home two days later to tell me that I had cancer. How did you tell your family members about your diagnosis? I was at home alone when I got the call, so my first call was to my husband. I felt bad that I had to call him at work, but he immediately came home to be with me. Next I called my parents who live several states away. They offered to book a flight immediately, but we had them wait until we got more information and I would really need some assistance. What types of breast cancer treatment did you receive? After my initial diagnosis, I was scheduled for another surgery. This surgery consisted of putting in a port, re-excising my lumpectomy (some of the initial margins weren\\'t clear), and doing a sentinel-node biopsy. Thankfully, my lymph nodes were clear. After surgery, I began chemotherapy. I had three rounds of FEC (5-FU, Epirubicin, Cytoxan) and then three rounds of Taxotere. Each round was given in three week intervals -- for approximately four months of treatment. I also was HER-2 neu positive, so starting during my Taxotere cycles, I began a weekly regimen of Herceptin. Once I finished the chemo, they adjusted my Herceptin schedule to every three weeks. I should finish it in December. After finishing chemo, I also received radiation treatment for 6 1/2 weeks. I was PR (progesterone receptor) negative, but focally weakly positive for ER (estrogen receptor). Although with a weak positive, the benefits are minimal, I have agreed with my doctor for the time being to take Tamoxifen. I am not sure that I will complete the five-year suggested regimen, but for now, I am on the treatment. How did you manage through breast cancer treatment? For me treatment was not as difficult as I expected it to be. Chemotherapy made me very fatigued and I was nauseated for a couple of days unless I kept my stomach full. I worked throughout treatment, although I would take a week off after each treatment. I was proud to say that I never vomited! The second week my blood counts would usually drop and I\\'d have to take an antibiotic, but I never had any serious complications. Radiation was a breeze compared to chemo. My appointment was at 8:15 a.m., so I went in every day before work. I didn\\'t miss a day of work on radiation. The Herceptin doesn\\'t cause any side effects for me (except I can smell the Herceptin coming out of all of my pores for the next day). I just leave works a couple of hours early every 3rd Wednesday, take a little nap in my chair and then go home. I have noticed zero side effects from the Tamoxifen.What has been your worst breast cancer moment? I think the worst moment for me was the day of my diagnosis when we went into the surgeon\\'s office to discuss the situation. Eric and I had planned to have our children two years apart. At the time of my diagnosis, my daughter was eight months old. We had planned to start trying to have the 2nd child in just six months. During that moment we realized that our plans were going to have to change. I would not be able to get pregnant in six months, it would be at least two years, maybe five, or worst case scenario, I may never be able to get pregnant again. This is still an issue that I struggle with. What has been your best breast cancer moment? There have been many good moments. The best thing for me is the amount of support from friends and family. I have never felt more loved. How do handle anxiety and worry related to breast cancer? In general I am not a worrier. Of course, anything abnormal still causes some anxiety. I pray and trust that God has a purpose for whatever happens in my life (good or bad). I also stay informed and research and anything that seems \"off\" to me, I make sure to discuss with my doctor.How has breast cancer changed your life? The biggest change for me is that I am working towards a total career change. Even before diagnosis, I felt like God was working on some big plan for me. I couldn\\'t get a grasp of what \"the plan\" was, but felt like somehow I needed to help women. When I prayed, the answer I got was \"wait\". Then I got cancer. I went to a spiritual retreat the week before I started chemo and finally the plan was revealed to me. I am going to go to medical school to be an OB/GYN. It\\'s a long process, but I\\'ve already taken two courses for my pre-requisites, and will continue to get my science classes, so I can apply. I was a business major in college, so this is a totally different path.What lessons have you learned through breast cancer? Faith is important. A good attitude makes a world of difference during your treatment. There is strength inside me that I never knew existed. Just by going through this experience and having a positive attitude, I can be an inspiration to others.Are you involved in any breast cancer support groups? Fundraisers? Organizations? I\\'m not currently involved in any breast cancer support groups (don\\'t have the time with work, class, and the family). I have helped with a mail project for cancer research, and plan on putting together a team for the next Race For the Cure. What advice would you give someone newly diagnosed? Be informed and share your thoughts with your doctors. Stay positive. Talk to other survivors. What advice would you give family members and friends of someone diagnosed with breast cancer? Don\\'t be afraid to talk about the cancer. Don\\'t always say, \"everything will be ok.\" Sometimes we need to talk about what happens if it isn\\'t ok and if you won\\'t talk about it, we\\'re all alone. When you offer help, you should be specific and give a time frame. Cancer patients may not want to ask for help, even if you said, \"call me if you need anything.\" It\\'s better to say, \"Let me bring you dinner on Friday.\" Comments: ',\n",

       " 'It\\'s day 15 in this Breast Cancer Awareness Month and the survivors spotlighted on this site are stacking up. Yet we\\'ve only just scratched the surface of breast cancer survivor stories. And by the end of October, we will have only featured a very small sample of survivors everywhere. There are countless others with their own powerful stories. It\\'s sad there are so many stories shaped by breast cancer. It\\'s empowering too -- because breast cancer survivors are a passionate bunch. They are passionate in their fights, passionate in their beliefs, passionate in their willingness to help others. A passionate bunch of survivors can be found here on The Cancer Blog. They are all women, of various ages, with various backgrounds, defined by different experiences. They are also quite the same -- for they have all been touched by breast cancer. And their words of wisdom are strikingly similar, despite the contrast in characteristics that define these women and their very individual battles with breast cancer.Here are seven survivor similarities worth spotlighting.   Most spotlighted survivors do not have a family history of breast cancer,   a fact that spans research on the disease. About 75 percent of women diagnosed   with breast cancer do not have a family history predicting their diagnosis.   Being female is the biggest risk factor for breast cancer.   All survivors turned in some way to research and resources to help them   along their paths to survival. The internet has served them well, although   patients should search carefully for reputable sites -- like the one provided   by the American Cancer Society -- for   accurate information. Books, like Dr.   Susan Love\\'s Breast Book, are also popular -- and so are personal blogs.   Many survivors recommend talking to other survivors for information and   comfort.   The survivors are in agreement when they suggest that loved ones offer   specific help following a new diagnosis. Stating, \"I will bring you dinner   every Monday\" is preferred to, \"Let me know how I can help.\"   Each survivor who graces this site is someone brave enough to share her   story, courageous enough to recount her breast cancer moments, selfless enough   to relive her tender emotions. She does it so that others can learn, so others   can benefit, so others can survive.   While these survivors are willing to open their worlds to others, they   share an ability to keep cancer in the shadows of their everyday lives. Cancer   is always present, but they allow the gift of each day to shine brighter than   the fear of a life-threatening disease.   Each day is truly a gift for these women who all comment in some way about   their fine-tuned appreciation for life and the people in it. They are able to   let the little things go -- the laundry, the dishes, a messy house -- in   exchange for the beauty of each moment.   While the little things go by the wayside, these survivors are champs at   conquering the big things. They feel they can tackle just about anything after   their dances with breast cancer. They are amazed at the strength they never   knew they possessed. Our spotlighted survivors share ups and downs, victories and struggles. They share an outside force -- breast cancer -- that descended upon them and forever shapes and molds them into new beings -- into people who somehow, in some way, are more fulfilled, more peaceful, happier than ever before. I think it\\'s the second chance at life that helps them live and hope and dream and lead. A second chance that helps them soar to new and greater heights. Comments: ',\n",
       " \"Just two months after her mother lost her battle with gall bladder cancer, Liane was diagnosed with breast cancer. It all happened earlier this year -- and while Liane is still mourning the loss of her mother, she is also still managing the madness of her own disease. Liane is surviving with courage, with determination, with the same powerful spirit that powered her mother's fight.Liane lives in a small city -- population 43,000 -- in northern Alberta Canada. She has been happily married for 18 years and has two daughters, ages 13 and 15, and a golden retriever named Sunny. Liane loves to garden, cook, read, and spend time with family. She normally works full-time in a real estate and property management office but has been blessed with six months off for treatment. Liane is already -- without a doubt -- a survivor.When were you diagnosed with breast cancer? April 21, 2006How old were you at the time of diagnosis? 45Do you have a family history of breast cancer? Not really. My mother-in-law survived inflammatory breast cancer 14 years ago, just when I was pregnant with my youngest. That was really a mixed time of emotions. We were welcoming a new baby into our family and at the same time worried to death about the poor prognosis my husband's mother had been handed. She was granted her miracle and is as alive as ever (she never stops!) today. My own mother was diagnosed with gall bladder cancer in February of 2005 and was also given a very poor prognosis. She fooled everyone and responded to her chemo treatments. Unfortunately she lost her fight on Feb 22, 2006, a full year after being told she had only months, maybe weeks, to live. Even so, her death broadsided us. She lived with us for the last eight years and was at home until the morning we had her brought to our only hospital. She passed away that afternoon.How did you find out you had breast cancer? On Easter morning I had an itchy spot on my right breast that just wouldn't go away. Then it was achy but I thought it was just normal achy before-my-period kind of achy. But this time it didn't go away and then my husband brought to my attention that there really was something there that hadn't been before. I knew too but I think I was still in that kind of dreamy, not really conscious state of mind that grieving seems to put you into when it just hurts too much to actually think about what you are feeling. When my husband verbalized what I had feared for the previous two weeks I found myself suddenly needing to run, not walk, to my doctors office. It just all seemed so surreal. How did you tell your family members about your diagnosis? I honestly don't remember. I do remember driving myself to my sister's and blurting it out and then both of us just crying for a long time. Later that day I vaguely remember sitting my girls down with gramma and grampa and telling them. It's all kind of a blur to me now. Everyone was so shocked and disbelieving I think.What types of breast cancer treatment did you receive? I had a mastectomy, sentinel node biopsy, and axillary node dissection. I am currently receiving FEC chemo -- just received my 4th dose of six, spaced three weeks apart. Only two more to go -- Yay!How did you manage through breast cancer treatment? The recovery from surgery was more painful than I had imagined. My dad and his wife drove from 10 hours away and cooked and cleaned while my little family just was. We were all like robots -- functioning but just. Chemo has been gross. I ended up in the hospital after #2 with an infection of unknown origin and extremely low blood counts. My doctor lowered the FEC dosage by 10 percent and the next two treatments went much better. I still get very tired. I swear I have every side effect listed for the chemo drugs as well as the anti nausea drugs. I find that keeping a little food in your tummy at all times helps with the nausea. Nothing tastes better than lemon drops when everything else tastes like kaka, and my daughter's soft blanket that she so willingly shared with me was soothing on my sore skin.What has been your worst breast cancer moment? When I was undergoing a lot of the testing for staging I had to go into the same diagnostic rooms and see the same technicians as I had accompanied my mother on one year before. It was very difficult to relive that. I wasn't even really able to worry about myself or what I was undergoing. When I was hospitalized after my second chemo they put me on the same floor that my mother spent her last day on. My nurse thought my tears were for me but when I told her what was going on in my mind, she told me that this sort of thing actually happened quite a bit, being such a small community with only one hospital. It made me realize that others have been in my shoes before me. When it came time for my first appointment with the cancer clinic I requested the same doctor who had treated first my mother-in-law and then my mother. I trust her implicitly. What has been your best breast cancer moment? Having that same doctor tell me that although there is no cure, I would be fine. That simple statement put me at ease and made me believe and look forward. How do handle anxiety and worry related to breast cancer? I talk to my mother-in-law who is full of experience and shares without reservation. My mom had a way of making me strong with just a few simple words. She taught me to believe in myself and I still talk to her too. My husband has been a rock. He holds me when I am having my moments and that is enough. I hold my girls when they let me (teenagers) and that has been a lot lately. My sister is just always there for me. My 2-year-old niece is also very therapeutic. I highly recommend keeping a few babies around when the going gets tough. How has breast cancer changed your life? I've learned to let the little things go and accept help from others. What lessons have you learned through breast cancer? We can handle a lot more than we may ever have imagined. Are you involved in any breast cancer support groups? Fundraisers? Organizations? We held a multi-family yard sale right after my surgery. My sister, our father and his wife worked for days. My sister made a big sign with a photo on it of my mom, myself, and my sister on my wedding day. My sister wrote that all proceeds that day would go to the Alberta Cancer Society in honor of our mother who had recently passed away. And the people bought and bought and bought. Some gave us money without buying anything. Many told us how they had lost a loved one or survived a diagnosis. It was bitter sweet because some of my mom's things went home with strangers. In the end we had almost $400 to donate. That was pretty amazing considering most items sold around the $1.00 mark! What advice would you give someone newly diagnosed? Let people help you. Now is not the time to try to do it all yourself even if you are that type. Listen to your body and don't push it. Talk to someone who's been there, done that.What advice would you give family members and friends of someone diagnosed with breast cancer? Talk about it! Communication is so important with any cancer diagnosis. There is so much fear associated with the word cancer and silence feeds that fear. Not everyone can handle all the information that is available but I for one, and my sister for another needed and wanted any and all info. with my mother. We found information comforting. Not knowing is not an option. Name any breast cancer related books or other resources you would recommend.The Cancer Blog, of course. I also found reading the blogs of others very comforting. For strictly the facts there are countless reliable sources on the web -- your local cancer society is likely the best starting point. What else would you like to share? None of us know when or how an illness might hit or how numbered our days are. Don't take your health for granted but don't live as though everything is a danger either. We still need to have fun. And appreciate those who love you. Comments: 1. I'm so very proud of you, Liane. You are doing amazing through your (only two more!) chemo treatments, not to mention being very brave and an inspiration to all of us. You definately are a survivor! 2. Stay strong, Liane. You're an amazing person, and I know you'll beat this thing.Best wishes, Molly\",\n",
       " 'On Saturday, I ran 3.1 miles. On Saturday, I made my official donation of more than $4,300 to the American Cancer Society. On Saturday, I won the honor of raising the most funds of any individual participating in my local Making Strides Against Breast Cancer event. I feel strong for having run when I never before imagined I could accomplish such a feat. I feel grateful to the 75 people who donated their hard-earned dollars so I could accept the glory -- and the gift of an iPod -- because of their generosity. I feel a rush of adrenaline, still days later, from the spirit that filled the two-hour event that earned breast cancer initiatives more than $130,000. And I feel completely absorbed in love by family and the special friends who were with me, who ran and walked and cheered with me, for me, for millions of women like me.I feel peace and tranquility at this very moment in time. These feelings are side effects of cancer -- the kind I hope never fade away. Comments: 1.

But his cancer spread, and his health declined. Yet his spirits remained high -- and he recently told one newspaper reporter, \"I\\'m one year away from 70 and I\\'ve had a good run.\"Fender\\'s career began when he returned from service in the Marine Corps in the late 1950s and created his stage name from a brand of guitar -- Fender.

       " \"Researchers have identified a damaged gene -- BRIP1 -- that doubles the risk of familial breast cancer in a small percentage of women. BRIP1 is a DNA repair gene that can lead to uncontrollable cell growth if not functioning properly. Researchers have concluded that the damaged gene increases risk for breast cancer from eight to 16 percent by age 70.These findings won't change patient care but they may offer comfort to women who develop breast cancer and cannot pinpoint the occurrence to the commonly mutated BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes -- mutations that are responsible for the disease 80 percent of the time. And while the study of BRIP1 does add to the pool of research on breast cancer, it does not warrant screening at this time. It's just a small piece of the puzzle that one day may prove significant. For now, the risk of breast cancer resulting from a damaged BRIP1 gene is modest. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"Dori died this past November after a long battle with breast cancer that recurred and spread and ultimately took her from her husband and two young children. I never knew Dori -- she was one of my blog acquaintances -- but I gather from her words and the hundreds of comments that were left on her site that she was full of spirit and courage and grace. Dori died gracefully at her home, with the assistance of hospice and a loving network of family and friends. She is no longer able to write in her blog -- No Bra Required -- and I miss her abundant strength and humor in the midst of a exhausting journey. But something happened that I think has eased the transition for those who are struggling with the death of a woman much too young to have left this world -- Dori's husband continued to write. He continued Dori's blog for a bit and then started his own personal blog where he shares the peaks and valleys of a life without Dori and with two kids he is raising on his own. Winter to Spring is insightful and touching and sad and happy. It chronicles birthday parties and school plays and Mother's Day too. It reveals feelings and hopes and wishes and sorrows. The tragedy of it all -- the death of Dori -- is devastating.

       " 'I took my boys yesterday for a tour of the University of Florida\\'s Department of Entomology and Nematology. Translation for these little boys -- ages five and three -- involves one simple word. Bugs. They love bugs, hunt for bugs, capture bugs, and reluctantly set them free because I coax them into allowing these itty bitty creatures to continue living with their \"mommies and daddies.\" I have a soft spot for all living beings -- bugs included.We learned some crazy facts about bugs yesterday -- insects is the proper term really. We learned there is one cockroach that can live for seven days without its head. We learned there are two types of Madagascar cockroaches living in a lab in the very same building we visited that if set free, would reproduce so quickly they would become a major pest problem in the state of Florida. And we learned that of all animals on this planet, most are insects. But not only did we learn some crazy facts, we -- well, Joey -- shared a crazy fact too.Joey is five years old. He is the boy who remembers much of my breast cancer journey. He is the one who helped shave my head, the one who thought a banana would make my sick tummy feel better. He\\'s the one who would blurt out to people we never knew very well, \"My mommy is bald,\" the one who asked me just last night if the metal thing -- my port -- was still in my chest. When I told him it\\'s gone, he jumped up and announced, \"Yeah, it\\'s gone!\" Cancer is one of many vocabulary words housed in Joey\\'s brain. And sometimes the word comes up unexpectedly, in strange contexts, in surprising ways. Like today.Our bug tour guide told us that in Africa, mosquitoes transmit diseases that kill millions of people. But those with sickle cell anemia are immune to the deadly diseases due to their compromised red blood cells that somehow fend off disease. This fact prompted Joey to share with the guide, \"Did you know when people have cancer, there are bugs that can kill the cancer?\" Our guide listened to this crazy fact and said in a kid-friendly way, \"No, I did not know that. Who told you that?\" Joey told her, \"I don\\'t remember but someone told me.\" I am not sure what prompted Joey to make this announcement. Perhaps he was trying to one-up the tour guide, to sound like an expert on one of his favorite subjects. Perhaps his imagination was in overdrive and he blurted out the best story he could offer. Perhaps he jumbled up a story he had heard on the topic of cancer. And perhaps he is just simply hopeful that one day, bugs will help cure cancer. And wouldn\\'t that be nice -- a simple mosquito comes along, pierces the skin, and poof, cancer is gone. My cancer journey would not be nearly as interesting, as enlightening, as tender if Joey was not along with me for the ride. He keeps me busy and keeps my spirits up. He keeps me grounded and keeps life simple. Best of all -- he keeps me laughing. Comments: ',\n",

       " \"The magazine Beyond: Live and Thrive After Breast Cancer made its public debut on September 19 when it arrived on the shelves of bookstores and grocery stores across the United States. And the magazine -- created to help breast cancer survivors nurture their physical and emotional health -- has caused quite a stir already. Readers of a previous Cancer Blog post introducing the magazine say they can't get enough it and can't wait for the next issue. Contributing Editor Martha Miller Johnson says it's been a crazy month for the magazine team. She reports that the magazine is selling incredibly well, that she is receiving the most amazing e-mails from a wonderful group of women. The Des Moines Register and Connecticut Post both have done big stories on the magazine and in the midst of the flurry of success, work has already begun on the next and second issue that will hit newsstands on March 20, 2007.Beyond is published by Meredith Special Interest Media twice per year in Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer editions. Currently, subscriptions are not available, but the magazine is available all across America and can also be purchased on-line.It's no surprise this magazine has caught the attention of people everywhere. It's a timely, colorful, glossy breast cancer handbook. It's chock full of candid stories, recent research, and helpful hints. It's a breast cancer community that is inspiring, hopeful, and completely comforting. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'Smoking is the biggest risk factor for lung cancer -- and 90 percent of all lung cancer cases are related to smoking. But family history is a risk factor too and can nearly double the risk of developing the deadly disease.A study published in the October issue of Chest found by studying a population of Japanese adults that people with a first-degree relative -- mother, father, or sibling -- who had lung cancer had a 95 percent higher risk of contracting the disease. Those who smoked had the greatest risk, but those who did not smoke were still at risk. And women were more at risk than men. The type of lung cancer most associated with family history is squamous cell carcinoma.The results of this study do not yet translate into recommended guidelines for screening. But those with a family history of lung cancer should make their physicians aware of their history. And perhaps one day people with family history will be identified as high-risk for lung cancer and will be included in further studies. In the meantime, these individuals should avoid all contact with all inhaled and second-hand smoke and should protect their children from all forms of tobacco smoke.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 180,000 cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year. About 170,000 die from the disease every year. It\\'s the second leading cause of death for men and the third leading cause of death for women. Comments: 1. Start comment! Good article let\\'s talk!2. Wee I knew smoking caused cancer, and since I have been smoking for 19 years I took a large step to quit. While I have yet to quit 100% yet, I have a deadline to quit by and use <A href=\"http://www.quitsmokingez.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.quitsmokingez.com/</A> to help me with my personal issues while quitting. I hope others can benefit from them as much as I did.Laura ',\n",
       " \"There are various risk factors that can contribute to the development of breast cancer. Being female is the single biggest risk factor that on its own puts all women in jeopardy. But there are other risks -- many beyond our control and some more significant than others -- that can help explain why some women are diagnosed with the most common cancer in women in the United States. And why others are not.AgeAs women age, their risk of breast cancer increases. Most breast cancer diagnoses occur in women over the age of 50.Personal history of breast cancerWomen who have had breast cancer are more likely to develop it again.Family history of breast cancerWomen with a first-degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) with breast or ovarian cancer are at risk of a breast cancer diagnosis.GeneticsWomen with inherited genetic mutations have an increased risk of breast cancer. Women with alterations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have an 85 percent chance of developing the disease at some point in their lives.High breast tissue densityWomen with high breast tissue density have more ducts and lobules and less fat -- and this puts them more at risk for breast cancer.Breast hyperplasiaHyperplasia is an increase in the growth of cells in a tissue. It can be detected only by looking at a sample of breast tissue under a microscope. If present, it increases risk.Lifetime exposure to estrogenThe longer a women is exposed to estrogen, the more risk she acquires. Risk is highest in women who began menstruating before the age of 12 and in women who went through menopause after the age of 55. Since estrogen strengthens bones, women with high bone mass may also be at risk.Not having children, or having children after the age of 30Estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy, so women who experience pregnancy have the benefit of diminished estrogen for a period of time. Not breastfeeding can also increase risk.Exposure to radiationPrior radiation to the chest area increases risk.Having Ashkenazi Jewish heritageWomen with this heritage have an increased risk due to possible mutated genes -- such as BRCA1 and BRCA2.Other possible risk factors include being overweight, lack of exercise, and drinking alcohol. Drinking just one drink per day can increase risk.These risk factors are only possibilities -- they are not definite, conclusive, without-a-doubt factors that will definitely result in breast cancer. A woman may have several of these characteristics and never develop breast cancer. And sadly, a woman may have none of these characteristics and still develop breast cancer. I developed breast cancer with three of these risk factors -- I have very dense breasts, I had my first child at age 30, and I did not breastfeed. But I was young when I was diagnosed -- 34 -- and since this is not a risk factor, it seems only fair this should cancel out one of my predictors. But clearly it doesn't. Even if it did, it wouldn't change anything. I still had breast cancer. And now I am more at risk of developing it again.There is no simple formula for determining who will get breast cancer. There are only possible predictors that can help us gauge our own risk. Still, these predictors are important -- they arm us with knowledge, with an awareness that helps us prepare for what may lie ahead. This awareness is critical. This month. Every month.

       " \"I remember thinking when my grandma was a spunky 80-year-old -- still going to aerobics classes in her purple tights -- that it must be sad to be such an age when so many friends and acquaintances are falling ill and passing away. My grandma was always one to care for others, call on others, pray for others -- and often she seemed to be the only one in her circle who was thriving. Somehow, she took it all in stride and continued baking and gardening and sewing and living strong until her own death at the age of 86 -- when she left her remaining friends and acquaintances wondering if their own time on Earth was approaching a quick end. At the time, I thought this loss of friends was merely a side effect of aging. It didn't seem to concern me at my own young age of 30. I didn't really know any 30-year-olds who were dying. And I didn't predict anyone my age would be dying until I was closer to the age of 80. How wrong I was.I am now 36 years old. And I know many women my age who have died -- most of them because of breast cancer, the same disease I have been fighting for nearly two years. So it's not only sad to me that people my age are dying, it's also quite personal and frightening -- for it could easily me in the same predicament. So I feel vulnerable -- so many years earlier than I imagined.I think I know how my grandma must have felt when her loved ones were leaving her. And I think I will take her same approach to coping with this unfortunate fact of life. Although I couldn't possibly bake and garden and sew like she did, I can keep busy with my own hobbies and interests. And I can continue living strong until my own death -- which hopefully won't occur until after I've made my appearance in purple tights. About 50 years from now. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"The breast cancer drug Tykerb may be one of the future wonder drugs available for women left with limited options for treating advanced-stage disease. Tykerb, manufactured by British-based GlaxoSmithKline PLC, is currently an experimental drug that delays growth of tumors nearly twice as long as standard chemotherapy in patients who no longer respond to Herceptin -- a targeted drug that significantly decreases chances of recurrence for women with HER2 positive breast cancer. Herceptin blocks the swift growth of an aggressive protein on the cell's surface while Tykerb does its work on the inside of the cell. Herceptin is given intravenously. Tykerb is given in pill form.Two previous posts -- one in April and one in June -- relfect the progress of Tykerb as reported in the media. With each new report, Tykerb seems to gain momentum and promise. And this past week, new reports revealed new promise as Glaxo began seeking regulatory approval of the Tykerb pill in Europe. Glaxo has filed an application with the Food and Drug Administration for approval of this drug and is preparing to market the drug for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in women. Glaxo hopes to launch Tykerb -- also known as lapatinib ditosylate -- next year. Comments: 1. I don't see why this drug won't be approved. It's a drug for advanced cancer; does that mean it's to prolong life but not get rid of the tumor? If it delays the growth of the tumor, does that mean it increases the chance of being able to remove the tumor completely? It's definitely a wonderful breakthrough. But it's a bit sad when I think of it as a pill to buy more time. I hope they find a cure for cancer soon. This pill is a positive sign that we are prgressing in the study of cancer treatment and cure. \",\n",
       " \"I've written twice before about a young woman named Diem Brown. I first wrote in August about her appearance as a contestant on MTV's Real World/Road Rules Challenge reality show. I wrote about how despite a recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer, she took herself to Australia to compete in physical and mental challenges with other spunky 20-something competitors. Brown, 25, fought for a cash prize of $250,000 -- while fighting cancer at the same time. Brown did not win the grand prize, but she did win the admiration and respect of her castmates who on an MTV reunion show applauded her tireless and heroic efforts. In my second post, in September, I wrote about Brown's presence on the reunion show, about her strength, about the great mindset she acquired prior to returning home from Australia for treatment. I wrote about her foundation -- Live for the Challenge -- a wedding-type registry that allows patients to register for prescriptions, wigs, anything that helps them manage their illnesses. I did not write about the wig Brown wore on the show -- but it was apparent she had lost her long, blond hair and was masking the most visible side effect of chemotherapy.Brown reluctantly yet powerfully unveiled her head on national television just a few nights ago during the beginning of another MTV Real World/Road Rules Challenge. During this installment -- The Duel -- Brown competes again, this time with the shortest of brown hair covering her scalp and with a fierceness that rivals anything she's offered on past shows.Brown is back. She's in Brazil. And she is beating cancer. Comments: 1. I am a survivor of a two year battle with Hodgkins lymphoma. I had a stem cell transplant last year, and have officially been in remission since last June.I am writing to express my admiration for MS.Brown. She has been an inspiration to me as well as other young adults who have been through the experience of fighting cancer. I want to thank her for letting the world see her courage and strength, and for giving our generation a face and person to care about, so that we can help to find better treatments and ultimately a cure for a disease that is destroying humankind.2. I am not a cancer patient, but I have been moved by Ms. Brown's story as I watched it unfold on the MTV's challenges. When I watched her struggle to take off her wig before a challenge, it was moving, and at the same time, scary. After watching her bravery, I have opened my eyes to how strong, and admiring women of my generation can be. She is beautiful, and has changed my outlook on life!3. Pleas e-mail me the cancer documentary. Diem is inspirational to all. I am going through sa disease right now and it is very hard to be the 6 percent op people in the country that get it. I had no idea at the age of 36, my life would be taken over by a disease. Thank you.4. Diem Brown has taught me that the way to handle an adverse situation is with more determination than ever before. She turns lemons into lemonaid! I love the medical gift registry she started as well. What a brilliant idea! I truly believe that she is making a difference in this world.5. Diem Brown is one of those people who have cancer, and dosen't let that get in her way. She is beautiful without hair or not, and I applaud her for her actions. She should teach the rest of us how to reach for our goal, no matter whatever obstacles that may come our way. And Diem has one of the biggest obstacles of all. She is an inspiration.6. I am not a cancer patient but i am also moved by her story...BUT that is not why i am writing this, i am writing because i think Diem should keep her hair short like it was on the show...i dig....would anyone agree\",\n",
       " 'Monday night is Courage Night, hosted by the Young Survival Coalition (YSC), national sorority Zeta Tau Alpha (ZTA), and Lifetime television. It\\'s a night when Lifetime\\'s Original Movie Why I Wore Lipstick to My Mastectomy will air, when crowds will gather in communities and on college campuses across the nation for special screenings and viewing parties of the movie that brings glaring attention to the issue of breast cancer.Courage Night was created in 2004 by Geralyn Lucas, author of the book Why I Wore Lipstick to My Mastectomy, as an evening of celebration in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. It was also a celebration of the publication of her then-new book.Lucas, diagnosed with breast cancer at age 27, recounts in her memoir every step of her cancer journey, including her bold application of red lipstick just before her mastectomy. She knew from the day she was diagnosed she would speak out to help others, to raise awareness, to make a difference. Now 39, a mother of two, and an executive for Lifetime, Lucas is still making waves. And Courage Night lives on.Courage Night has grown into a national grassroots event that honors breast cancer survivors and those lost to the disease. Event fundraising will benefit YSC -- the only organization dedicated to the special issues of young breast cancer survivors.Why I Wore Lipstick to My Mastectomy, starring actress Sarah Chalke, will air Monday, October 23 at 9:00 PM. Comments: Courage Night has grown into a national grassroots event that honors breast cancer survivors and those lost to the disease. Event fundraising will benefit YSC -- the only organization dedicated to the special issues of young breast cancer survivors.1. i watched the Gerlayn Lucas story on LifeTime is was so profound that I have not been able to get it off my mind as of yet. What courage and what a fine example Geralyn gives to young and old alike. My sister-in-law had breast cancer several years ago and is definately a survivor. She had a double mascectomy and has not given up from day one. We al wonder how we will react to this news but Geralyn and my sister-in-law give the name SURVIVOR 2. My computer sent the message on before I was able to fininsh my sentence. Geralyn and my sister-in-law give the word SURVIVOR a whole new meaning. I just felt that I needed to share these thoughts because I again was truly overwehlmed by the movie and her desiring to share such a passionate story.3. after reading the book \"Why I Wore Lipstick\" it really made me think about how much i really appriciate the things in my life. I dont think that i really appriciated the things that i do have before i read this book. I really felt like what i was going through as a sixteen year old was tragic and i didnt think i was going to get through it. I love books like this because it goes to show even through the hardest times in our lives as women we can get through anything. You know people dont really think this but women are tougher than they look. If you dont believe me then read books about women who who have cancer or go through something hard and make it and then tell me that we arent tough. When i was reading this book it really made me kind of scared cause i thought well maybe i could have breast cancer in the near future and that scares me. Well then i really started to think and if i got it then i could fight it as hard as i could and hopefully live to tell my story to help other women get through their hard times like it helped me get through mine. I dont have breast cancer but a story like Gerylns really helped me. So even a breast cancer survivor really can reach out to other people besides the victims of breast cancer. It goes alot further than that. So Geryln thank you for telling your inspiring story. I really encourage people to read it!4. MY WIFE DIED OF BREAST CANCER AT THE AGE OF 52. SHE BEAT IT THE FIRST TIME, BUT IT CAME BACK 4 1/2 YEARS LATER. WHEN SHE HAD IT THE FIRST FIRST TIME, I REALISED WHAT SHE REALLY MENT TO ME. WHEN SHE DIED, WE HAD BEEN MARRIED FOR 28 YEARS. I SERIVED A YEAR IN VIET NAM AND I RELISED THAT SHE HAD MORE CORRAGE AND STRINGTH THEN I EVER HAD. WE HAD TWO KIDS STILL AT HOME WHEN SHE DIED, 13 AN 17 YEARS OLD. I LEARNED HOW TOUGH IT IS TO BE A WORKING MOTHER. I, TO THIS DAY DON\\'T KNOW HOW SHE DID IT. MY WIFE WAS GODS GREATEST GIFT TO ME. I MISS HER VERY MUCH.',\n",
       " 'I have a new friend who is a new breast cancer survivor. She is surviving a new diagnosis, a recent lumpectomy, and the moments leading up to another surgery to further investigate the margins surrounding the tumor removed from her breast. She is surviving the first phase of her breast cancer journey. A phase full of uncertainty and fear and panic. A phase so new and so fresh and so raw, her mind is whirling. A phase that has her grasping for any bit of direction she can find as she navigates a terrifying, unfamiliar road.My friend is a young wife and mother whose worries are consuming her. She e-mailed me today and asked if I ever have moments when I look at my young children and worry that cancer will take me from them while they are young. She asked if I have always been so sure I will be okay. And so I replied with this candid cancer confession.I look at my boys every day -- mostly at night when they are sleeping and peaceful and perfect and when cancer makes me most emotional -- and wonder \"what if I am not here for them for very long?\" I think all the time \"if I died right now, am I confident they will be okay?\"Just before I went for my first Herceptin treatment -- and just after I had read that a few women died from an allergic reaction to the drug -- I started writing a bunch of notes for my husband for after I died. I told him where to buy the boys good shoes and I listed the names of all their doctors. I reminded my husband to remember to cut their fingernails and toenails and to e-mail everyone in my address book about my death. I wrote and I cried -- and my notes sit right behind me right now on a bookshelf. I did not die -- and the notes were not necessary. Only a few women died from Herceptin and they all had previous health issues. I am not sure why I got all worked about it --- I went on to have not one side effect from the treatment really. It was not really the Herceptin, I guess -- it was the cancer. It\\'s always on my mind, always will be. How can we not contemplate death when it is happening to young women just like us? So, yes, I think about dying. But my gut tells me I will be okay for some time. My gut has served me well. I think there will come a time when yours will serve you well too!And after I wrote this, I thought about other confessions I could reveal that might shed some light on my whole realm of surviving cancer. So here are six more completely candid cancer confessions.Candid Confession #2I truly, deeply, genuinely fear that every ache, pain, and twinge of discomfort I experience will lead to another cancer diagnosis. A bump on the roof of my mouth, a gurgling stomach, a lingering headache, an odd shape of tissue in my breast, pain in my esophagus -- each of these discoveries has sent me into a tailspin of panic, relieved only by a visit to a physician for exams that rule out my worst fear. Rationally, I know my fears are irrational. Logically, I am fine. Emotionally, I am not.Candid Confession #3I can\\'t imagine how I would emotionally cope with pregnancy now that I\\'ve had cancer. I can\\'t imagine feeling calm and peaceful and serene while contemplating the possibility of a recurrence while pregnant, the possibility of a recurrence after pregnancy, the possibility that my early death would leave my husband with the monumental responsibility of three children, the possibility of a birth defect resulting from the poisonous drugs that for two years have been swirling through my body, the possibility I would give birth to a baby girl and would pass on to her the legacy of breast cancer. The possibilities are endless. And yet I want the same third baby I wanted moments before I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I just don\\'t know if the gamble is worth it. And I don\\'t know if the regret will haunt me when I turn out to be alive and well with two grown boys.Candid Confession #4I have been open and honest with my little boys about breast cancer. They know the basics. They know I had a boo-boo in my boobie, they know it was removed, they know medicine took my hair and made me better. They know the word cancer, they know it\\'s a sickness, they know at the time being, we are done with it. But they are young -- five and three -- and have no real understanding of the word. They have no comprehension of what cancer can really do, can really take away from us all. And so there is a little pit in my stomach that aches for my little boys whose lives will forever be touched by cancer in ways none of us can predict. They are innocent and unsuspecting. I am afraid of what cancer might do to their simple souls.Candid Confession #5I am afraid of what cancer will do to me -- short of the whole death thing. I am afraid of the chemotherapy drug Adriamycin that seeped into my veins and can be toxic to my heart. I am afraid of the drug Herceptin that sailed through my same veins over the course of one year that can also damage my heart. I am afraid of the sun because of an allergic reaction caused by my chemotherapy drugs. And I am afraid of chemo brain -- the mental fogginess I periodically experience that can prevent me from remembering my own phone number and can sometimes wipe out my short-term memory.Candid Confession #6I have never been a fan of medication and even tried to avoid drugs to minimize treatment side effects. So when my oncologist recommended an anti-depressant during treatment to help manage my constant tears and constant anxiety, I was reluctant. Not until he convinced me that many cancer patients benefit from anti-depressants to take the edge off heightened emotion did I agree to try a daily dose of Zoloft. It worked -- in combination with counseling -- and I am not afraid to confess that this medication helps me survive. Candid Confession #7In spite of my fears and my worries and my panic, I truly am okay. I am happy and confident and downright positive for most minutes of most days that I will survive this disease that makes me a bit unstable at times. Therefore, my most important cancer confession is this -- I have dark moments and I have dismal days and I have decisions facing me that I can\\'t even begin to make. But I am alive right now. I am healthy. I have two beautiful children and a loving family who keep me smiling. And if it wasn\\'t cancer, it would be something else popping up to plague me. I\\'m okay with cancer -- and in an odd way, I like that it keeps me thinking and analyzing and reflecting. I like that it helps me help others -- like my new friend, a new breast cancer survivor. Comments: 1. Cancer of any kind is terrifying and those who have commented show immense courage. Do they know that FDA approved clinical trials might be available that could ease their suffering. What clinical trials are all about, how to find an appropriate trial and how to gain admission are presented in \"Stem Cells Saved My Life - How to be Next\" which can be ordered at any on-line bookstore.2. Most of us think that the use of stem cells to currecancer is many years away, primarily becasue of the controversy surrounding embryonic stem cells. But, there are hundreds of FDA approved clinical trials of adult stem cells (from our own bodies)that are available right now for several types of cancer.You can get help in finding those trials at clinicaltriallocator.org.

       " \"There is no major test or screening tool or exam that reveals the definite presence of cancer in the body. There are mammograms that can detect suspicious masses in the breast and there is a blood test that might raise concerns about the health of ovaries and there are various x-rays and scans that allow doctors to peek into the intricacies of the human body -- and some tests, like the mammogram clearly do save lives -- but some tests that seem harmless can damage the psyche while accomplishing little else.I asked my oncologist how he would know if my breast cancer returns. He said I will receive regular mammograms and ultrasounds of my breasts. And he will perform in-office exams every few months. He will complete a breast exam and will feel my neck for enlarged lymph nodes. He will listen to my lungs and feel my stomach. But largely, he will rely on me to report symptoms and signs and complaints -- because these are the true indicators that something is amiss. I imagined myself getting a whole host of tests on my whole body to rule out that cancer is invading every part of me. But this won't happen without reason -- because some tools, like imaging tests, may detect noncancerous abnormalities and false positives that lead to unnecessary psychological stress and tests -- and sometimes even surgery. So if I develop a persistent cough that can't be controlled, perhaps my oncologist will order a chest x-ray. If headaches begin to plague me and relief is not in sight, then perhaps a scan of my head will be in order. But as long as I feel well, the assumption is that I am well. It's better for my soul this way -- to live life without the constant worry that cancer will return. And it's a whole lot more cost effective too. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'A few days ago, notification of an e-mail arrived in my inbox. It popped up right in front of me, with the sender\\'s name -- Amy Wilson -- glaring in black print right before my eyes. Amy is my friend who was diagnosed with breast cancer just after my own diagnosis. We e-mailed frequently about our cancer hopes and fears and so it was never before odd that a message would travel from her computer in Ohio to mine in Florida. But on the day this one e-mail arrived, it was odd -- because Amy died two weeks ago, after a 15-month battle with the disease we both vowed to conquer.The e-mail was not from Amy. It was from her husband, Paul. And it was as comforting to hear from him as it was odd to see Amy\\'s name flash in front of me. You see, I have wanted to call Paul, e-mail Paul, send a card to Paul -- something. I have wanted to reach out in some way, even though I have never met the man who thought he would spend the rest of his life raising his two children with Amy. But I never could figure out what I would write or say or send. I have been afraid that it would be hard for him to talk about Amy\\'s death. I\\'ve been afraid that it would be hard for me to talk about her death. So I have waited, hoping the passage of time would help prepare me for some sort of action. And in the end, time was not necessary. Because Paul reached out to me. And this is what he wrote in the e-mail he sent from Amy\\'s mailbox.I\\'m Amy\\'s husband Paul and I was going through Amy\\'s e-mail and noticed your e-mail. I\\'m not sure if Ericha told you or not but Amy passed away 10/05/06. Here is the story:http://www.ohio.com/mld/ohio/15693317.htm If you\\'re hearing this for the first time, sorry to tell you over e-mail. You were a great inspiration to Amy. Your quote \" Fight the Good Fight\" was front and center on our fridge. Please don\\'t let this news get you down, Amy would want your chin up, would want you to keep fighting. Thanks for all your support.And now I can contact Paul, because he has opened the door. He -- the one suffering the greatest loss -- has comforted me. And now I need to thank him. Comments: ',\n",
       " 'Author and breast cancer survivor Barbara Delinsky has just released an updated edition of her book UPLIFT: Secrets from the Sisterhood of Breast Cancer Survivors and like her previous editions, this one delivers inspiring real-life stories from real-life survivors -- like Deb Haney, an administrative assistant diagnosed in 1996 at age 48, who reveals her secret to surviving breast cancer in the workplace. \"My boss at the time was my brother. He suggested I go for radiation treatment in the morning, work a few hours, then go home and rest in the afternoons. That is what I did, because even though I looked great, I was unbelievably tired. When illness comes, we need to listen to our bodies and give them the time to rest and recover. I hadn\\'t anticipated it, but those afternoon hours became a truly peaceful, nurturing time to read and rest and enjoy quiet time.\"Delinsky offers a chapter in her book called A Workplace Manual -- it\\'s a place where survivors like Haney share strategies that helped them maintain the crucial balance between cancer and work. Delinsky writes, \"What works for one woman may not work for another. What works in one job may not work in another. The thing is, you need to take a step back, think about yourself and your situation, then speak up about what may work for you. In every situation, you have choices, and the choices are all good. What pleases one woman may not please another.\" And so the women featured in UPLIFT share their individual choices. And their choices become options for the millions of women surviving a disease that throws everything off balance.Rosamary Amiet, a program manager diagnosed in 2000 at age 48, shares, \"I juggled cancer and work by just giving up some things, like housework. I discovered that the house could go for weeks without being vacuumed or dusted -- and not only did the sky not fall, it didn\\'t even crack!\"UPLIFT is not all about the workplace. It\\'s also about chemotherapy and losing hair and losing breasts. It\\'s about family and humor and men. It\\'s about religion and exercise and diagnosis. It\\'s about help. It\\'s about hope. It\\'s about sisterhood -- plain and simple. Comments: ',\n",

       " 'Celebrities catch our attention. They cause us to pay attention too -- which is likely why the media uses celebrities and prominent people to send messages about all sorts of issues, like breast cancer. It\\'s not just the real-life survivor celebrity stories -- about Melissa Etheridge and Elizabeth Edwards and Sheryl Crow -- that make headlines and attract ratings. It\\'s also the portrayal of cancer survivors on television that raises awareness about this disease. It\\'s not a new trend -- it started long ago when All in the Family\\'s Edith Bunker (Jean Stapleton) experienced a breast cancer scare, marking one of the first times the issue of breast cancer was discussed openly on TV.Tough cop Mary Beth Lacey (Tyne Daly) of the TV show Cagney &amp; Lacey traveled a breast cancer journey. Sisters eldest sister Alex (Swoosie Kurtz) was diagnosed with breast cancer and survived chemotherapy with family by her side. Beverly Hills, 90210 character Brenda Walsh (Shannen Doherty) found a lump in her breast and shed light on the fact that young women are not immune to breast cancer. Sex and the City\\'s Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall) developed breast cancer and proudly pulled off her wig on television. The L Word\\'s Dana Fairbanks (Erin Daniels) lost her battle with breast cancer. And on Angela\\'s Eyes, FBI agent Angela Henson recently learned her mother once had breast cancer -- and that it has come back.There are many others television story lines woven with the thread of breast cancer. They draw viewers and boost ratings. They also raise awareness -- because people pay attention to celebrities. Comments: 1. Actress ANN JILLIAN was a great source of inspiration for me and so many million of other ladies who have had to deal with breast cancer. Her movie \"The Ann Jillian Story\" is the reason I\\'m alive. It gave me courage to go get a mammogram and I detected my breast cancer while it was still small and I also saved my breasts. Than you ANN JILLIAN, we all love you best out of all the celebs who got b/c, your #1.! god bless you.I so happy to have met Ann Jilllian when she spoke today in Greensboro, N.C. she is fantastic!

       " \"Technology has come a long way over the years -- and now the technology behind digital mammography is allowing life-saving screenings for the toughest patients to diagnose with breast cancer. This is no small technological breakthough. It is a critical component for lowering the breast cancer death rate the American Cancer Society reports has declined 2.3 percent each year between 1990 and 2002. Since breast cancer is a treatable disease if caught early, digital mammography will up the odds of survival for women with this disease.Digital mammography operates according to a computer-based technique that allows for digital manipulation of a breast X-ray. It exceeds the capability of film mammography -- and is much like the comparison between digital photography versus film photography. Both work. But one works better.Studies show digital mammograms have a lot to offer. They detect tumors better in young women with dense breast tissue, for example. They allow for ease of storage and retrieval of images. And they can easily become part of a woman's electronic medical record. There are still benefits of traditional mammography and women are still urged to use this less expensive option. They are also urged to conduct self-breast exams and to report for clinical exams with physicians. It's the whole package that contributes to comprehensive breast health, not just one isolated test. When used in combination with all other screening methods, digital mammography makes for a more accurate overall picture. Comments: 1. I wanted to correct my website address for any one interested in a digial mammography center in Irvine, California.2. Thank you for this input. As a mammographer for over 30 years, I have seen many changes in mammography. Digital mammography is the best yet in my opinion. I perform digital mammography everyday at my work in a screening digital mammography center. I personally would not have anything but a digital mammogram now.It takes less than 15 minutes. The images are unbelieveable and the managing of your images is very convenient. The ability for the radiologist to futher examine the image with magnification etc. allows for less calling back of the patient for additional views. I hope all women will have this new technology available to them soon. \",\n",
       " \"The overall cure rate for the 20,000 children diagnosed with cancer in the United States each year is more than 75 percent. Sounds good -- especially when 50 years ago, most children diagnosed with cancer died. But considering that only one in three childhood cancer survivors remain healthy, perhaps this is not such good news.Thirty years after diagnosis, about 40 percent of survivors have a serious health problem and one-third have multiple problems. Strokes, heart disease, and kidney failure are just a few of the major health concerns that plague many survivors who have entered adulthood.Doctors have long known that cancer treatments can cause new cancers later in life. But the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study -- the largest ever childhood study of its kind -- shows there are other long-term health problems. Researchers studied 10,000 survivors -- past studies examined 200-300 survivors -- and found these survivors were eight times as likely as their siblings to develop severe and life-threatening conditions. They found survivors of bone tumors, nerve and brain cancer, and Hodgkin's disease faced the highest risk.The source of these later-in-life health problems vary. Kidney failure may result from damage caused by chemotherapy or radiation or the infections children suffer when their immune systems are weakened. Drugs used to treat infections may also be to blame. Strokes may result from head and chest radiation.Cancer treatment for people of all ages comes with a price. We buy time, we buy life in exchange for the unknown. But for children -- who stand to live longer than adults -- there is a greater unknown. Sadly, there is a dark side to surviving cancer.

       " 'I am in a slump. I feel tired and slow and unmotivated. And ever since October 14 -- when I ran in the 5K Making Strides Against Breast Cancer event -- I can\\'t seem to find the inspiration to exercise. I am making myself do it -- here and there -- but my usual drive and push and spunk are missing. Typically, I crave exercise and feel lethargic if I don\\'t accomplish some sort of daily physical challenge. But for the past week or so, I have no craving, no desire to walk or run or lift weights, no appetite for my usual fitness routine. I am just plain tired.Fatigue is a common side effect of cancer treatment -- even years after treatment ends, according to some experts. So perhaps my drop in energy and enthusiasm is due to the cumulative effect of my own treatment for breast cancer that just ended in June. My treatment spanned almost two years. Maybe it\\'s no surprise my body is lagging behind my expectations for physical health. Experts also say exercise helps combat fatigue. I believe this -- it\\'s why I usually like exercise. It boosts my adrenaline, perks me up, makes me feel alive. If only I could get back into the swing of things, these feelings might come flooding back. But right now, I am not even thinking about how to find my old groove. I am just too tired. Comments: 1. FYI - there\\'s a new study out in the Journal of Clinical Oncology that may be helpful for cancer survivors experiencing severe fatigue. The study shows that Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) can significantly reduce fatigue &amp; functional impairment among cancer survivors... summary and link are at <A href=\"http://www.cttoday.org/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.cttoday.org/</A>, under \"Research Results,\" if anyone\\'s interested. 2. The loss of energy after completing an event is very common, especially if you do not have another event or goal to work toward. When we add to this the additional physical stress we have from treatment we can create the perfect environment for overwhelming feelings of fatigue.I ran the Columbus Marathon on the 15th of October and am also working my way through the post-race blahs. And even though my last treatment was not as recent as yours, I still must remember to give myself extra time to heal after competing. Here is what I do.1)Keep the same schedule for training that I used before the event, but cut back on the intensity. i.e. Instead of running for an hour, I will walk for an hour, do an hour of Yoga, or pedal an easy pace on a stationary bike for an hour.2)Pick out my next event. Once my body is ready, I start training for that goal. These days, I usually have my next two or three events already planned. I try to keep them about a month apart and vary the type of event to keep it interesting.3)Use mini-goals and rewards. If I keep my workout schedule for the first week, I get a movie or some other small treat. Each week until I am back to full training has a goal and a reward.Keep up the good work and I hope to see you at a race sometime. - paul3. I am a breast cancer survivor. I had my lump removed a year ago and just had to undergo radiation treatments. I too loved to exercise, but since the treatments am just too tired to get going again. I made the comment to a friend, that I don\\'t think I will ever feel like the \"Me\" before the cancer. Just this week I have started working out on my ellipical trainer and have felt very good afterwards. Hope this helps boost my energy levels.',\n",
       " 'And now it is time for a well-deserved introduction to Dalene Entenmann, Life Sciences lead blogger. Dalene not only writes her heart out for the blogs she manages -- The Cancer Blog, The Diabetes Blog, and The Cardio Blog -- she also guides and enlightens and inspires those of us she leads to represent through words all sorts of topics pertaining to these health issues.It is my pleasure to share with you today words that come straight from Dalene -- words that capture the spirit and passion of this talented woman.So without further ado, I introduce you to breast cancer survivor and writer extraordinaire Dalene Entenmann.When did you become a Life Sciences blogger? February 2006. In May 2006, I became the Life Sciences lead blogger. As a writer and a blogger, it has been a dream job and a phenomenal opportunity to get paid to do what I love to do.How has cancer touched your life? In March 2002, I found a lump in my breast while showering. In May 2002, one week before Mother\\'s Day, I was diagnosed with stage 2 infiltrating lobular breast cancer and positive node involvement. The 2.5 cm tumor had a moderately differentiated tumor grade and the surgical margin was compromised. In addition, I had other suspicious calcifications in both breasts. I was 47.The day I was given my personal copy of the pathology report, I folded it up and slipped it into my Day Planner. It has been there ever since. At the time of diagnosis, my prognosis was not the best one you can get if you are diagnosed with breast cancer. It wasn\\'t the worst one either. In the last four-and-a-half years, I have re-read the report from time to time. All the feelings I felt the first time I read it come back full force. It is a reminder of how blessed I am in how far I have been able to come. I am still here. My children have not had to attend the funeral of their mother. My gratitude for being a cancer survivor is tempered with survivor\\'s guilt. There is a part of my heart that is, and will remain, heavy with sadness and loss that all cancer patients do not survive. I cannot seem to accept the inequity.Needless to say, the life I had always known stopped the day I was diagnosed with cancer and was transformed in challenging and interesting ways I could not have imagined ahead of time. What advice would you give the newly-diagnosed cancer patient?Although surviving cancer is a mysterious process to me -- because I do not understand why some of us survive when others do not -- in Cancer Go Away and 5 ways to create hope I wrote about some of the things I did when I was first diagnosed with breast cancer. Believe in your healers -- then have faith they will do everything they can, as expertly as they can, to help you heal. Know your options -- you may not like your options but you must always realize that you have options. Know you are not alone. Never accept blame -- do not blame yourself or allow others to suggest that somehow you caused your cancer. Accept responsibility for the changes you can make to help with your healing, but never accept blame.What advice would you give loved ones of someone diagnosed with cancer?Just be there. Go with them wherever they need to go. Be a listener. Don\\'t worry about doing the wrong thing or saying the wrong thing. Your love will shine through. What advice would you give cancer survivors?That cancer is something that happened to you but is not a part of who you are -- do not own the cancer -- try not to allow it to define you. You are bigger than the cancer. Because I allowed my fear to run away with me on more than one occasion, I share this well-earned advice: try not to panic. If you spent the entire day gardening, and at the end of the day you feel all achy and sore, it doesn\\'t mean you have bone cancer. Not every headache is a brain tumor. Surround yourself with things that are life-affirming. Each day, find something that inspires you. A quote, a sunrise, the giggling laughter of a child. Each day, take a humor break. What are some of your favorite quotes:\"We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one\\'s predicament into a human achievement.\" -- Viktor E. Frankl from Man\\'s Search For Meaning\"Our prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can\\'t help them, at least don\\'t hurt them.\" -- The Dalai Lama \"The world is too dangerous for anything but truth and too small for anything but love.\" -- William Sloane Coffin, Jr.\"All that glitters is not gold.Not all those who wander are lost.The old that is strong does not wither.Deep roots are not reached by the frost.\" -- Tolkien Name three books you would recommend for those touched by cancer:Any book Bernie Siegel has written.Pronoia by Rob Brezsney.A blank journal to tell your own story. Who inspires you?My three children -- each one of them is a uniquely fascinating, intelligent, talented and authentic human being with an exquisite spirit and heart that extends into this world and lights it up brighter than it ever would have been otherwise. My husband for his hilarious sense of humor and for his calm response to my impassioned approach to life. The pioneering independence and courage of the women and men who are my ancestors. The women I call sisters in survivorship who possess a profound tender vulnerability and at the same time, a strength as tough as steel. All people who are working to make this world a better place. What inspires you?The goodness of people. When you are not writing for TCB, what do you do?I am trying to find more balance, and a shift into activities that reflect the future I envision for myself. Cancer overshadowed my perspective and hijacked the direction I was headed in before the diagnosis of breast cancer. I truthfully cannot remember where I was going before cancer. Right now, I am working on launching a blog about the creativity, comfort and charm of cottage life and in the middle of writing an almanac. I love to spend time in the kitchen adapting recipes, cooking, gardening and creating healing home environments.Visit Meet the Bloggers to read about the other fabulous bloggers who make up the our health blogs team. Comments: 1. Hello! I am a woman in my mid-50s. In January 2005, I was diagnosed with the same condition Farah Fawcett has, and subsequently underwent six weeks of treatment consisting of radiation and chemo. The treatment was brutal and I am still recovering from it. Thankfully, I had a clean biopsy last August. However, what has been difficult psychologically is that I have had no one to \"compare notes\" with, as the condition is so uncommon. Even the counselor from the hospital where I was treated could not hook me up with a \"mentor,\" nor could the American Cancer Society! Can you possibly put me in contact with someone who has been through this ordeal and willing to \"share?\" I noticed when reading about Farah Fawcett, that a few other people had written to say they had been through the same, but I don\\'t know how to get in touch with them. Any help would be greatly appreciated. -Tanya Johns, West Palm Beach, FL.',\n",
       " 'Living Beyond Breast Cancer (LBBC) -- a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering all women affected by breast cancer to live as long as possible with the best quality of life -- recently began offering a new resource for breast cancer survivors, for both the newly diagnosed and those with metastatic disease.\"The first few weeks after diagnosis can be extremely difficult emotionally, and women with advanced disease often do not get the support and resources they need,\" said Jean Sachs, LBBC executive director. \"We want to give them an understanding of their choices to help them make informed decisions regarding their physical and emotional health.\"This understanding comes in the form of a 28-page brochure -- What to expect . . . today, tomorrow and beyond: Steps for coping with the medical, emotional and practical concerns of breast cancer -- available free on the Internet or by request. This guide, a road map, addresses topics such as coping with the news of a new diagnosis, telling family and friends, understanding pathology reports, choosing a medical team, asking for help, and finding support.LBBC offers multiple addidtional resources -- including specialized navigation tools on its website that lead to a wealth of information. Visitors can Learn More about LBBC. They can Stay Informed through news, message boards, and other resources. They can Participate in events and programs. And they can Support LBBC through volunteer efforts and financial donations. LBBC was founded in 1991 by a radiation oncologist who focused exclusively on meeting the needs of women post-treatment. She ran the organization out of the third floor of her home using volunteers. Few resources existed for women affected by breast cancer at the time, and so she tried to fill the void. In 1986, an executive director came on board, increased the LBBC budget from $100,000 to $1.8 million per year, expanded all programs and services, and worked to secure LBBC as a solid, dependable resource for all women, of all stages of breast cancer and in all phases of treatment and recovery. And now, in 2006, that is exactly what it is. Comments: ',\n",
       " 'Photographs tell powerful stories. They depict people and objects and landscapes and emotions in deep, meaningful ways. They capture permanent visual representations of moments in life. They paint pictures that even the most well-crafted words could not reproduce. When Mary Ann Nilan was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 at the age of 40, she knew her story must be told -- through pictures. So she asked a photographer to record it all, stating, \"I hope the pictures make the road easier for other women.\" The rest is history.She calls it a photo essay and titles it The Diary of Healing. For 17 frames -- with photographs dominating each space and text kept to a minimum -- Nilan shares her journey that began with the discovery of breast cancer in both breasts and several lymph nodes, the journey that took her through chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, and reconstruction with implants.Her photographs document significant stops on her physical and emotional trek. They show her bald head, the wig she wore only once and then let hang on a hook, the scars that crossed her flat chest after surgery, an injection of saline that painfully pierced the skin of her new breasts, her children measuring her hair as it grows in after chemotherapy. The photographs are both hopeful and chilling. They are breast cancer. They are more than words could ever capture. Comments: ',\n",
       " \"In celebration of today -- National Cancer Survivors Day -- I attended a BBQ event at the American Cancer Society's Hope Lodge. The Hope Lodge, here in Gainesville, Florida, houses out-of-town cancer patients and their families so they can live in town temporarily while undergoing treatment at Shands Hospital at the University of Florida. So these patients were able to easily attend the festivities today -- which included a BBQ lunch, gift bags, a keynote speaker, and a tour of the Lodge. Survivors from the community attended too for an uplifting afternoon of camaraderie.My time at the event was limited. My boys, ages five and three, were with me and while they were entertained for a while by cookies and a fish tank and the box of mints that came in my gift bag, I knew their energy was best spent in the outdoors where they are always peaceful and content. And so goes my story with cancer -- I don't have much time to focus on this disease because of these two little men who distract me and keep me on my toes and redirect me with not a moment's notice. It's a blessing really -- the distraction -- because I get to spend more time on the joyous moments of my life and not on the worrisome ones. I get to watch my boys pick up sticks and turn them into fishing poles and watch turtles swim in lakes and dig in the dirt in search of shells. The official survivor celebration today was great -- while it lasted -- and I feel honored to be a part of a community of cancer survivors that in the United Stated is 10 million strong. But I must say that the best celebration for me today was the chance to really watch my boys, to really play with them, and to feel truly thankful for these two little angels who allow me to happily survive.

       " \"Some mechanism has been at work in my body for the past month, some sort of filter that has somehow warded off the crippling panic that typically overcomes me during health scares. It's the panic that allows me to turn a simple cough into a symptom of lung cancer, a stomach pain into a sign of ovarian cancer. It's the curse of surviving cancer, I guess -- the continual worry that the disease is coming back, that it is going to strike someone dear to me.Yet cancer never entered my mind when my husband and I began noticing our three-year-old Danny's strange eye movements, the strikingly odd manner in which one eye rolls upward when he gazes toward the ceiling -- this is normal -- while the other only crosses -- this is not normal. Surprisingly, I was not overly worried about this and was sure it was something that with glasses or eye exercises could be fixed. Never did I fear cancer.We started with our pediatrician who quickly knew this issue was out of his league. I was calm. He moved us on to a pediatric eye specialist who was stumped by these eye movements that are typically congenital and occur much earlier in life. If not congenital, it must be something acquired, this doctor told us. He looked around a bit at Danny's eyes, dilated his pupils, and tested his vision. He determined his eyesight is perfect. And his gaze is a complete mystery. He ordered an MRI.Still I was okay -- until my husband shared one evening with me that he was worried about a tumor. Why I hadn't yet obsessed about this is its own mystery, for which I am thankful. It allowed me to function for a short time independent of fear and anxiety and only a short time ago did I let panic seep into my consciousness. When I scheduled the MRI for Danny and was told it was an urgent case that must be scheduled quickly, my stomach sank. When the doctor who would read the MRI met with us this morning to talk about this diagnostic procedure, he shared that a mass is what they would be looking for. I'm not sure how for all these weeks I missed this opportunity to get all worked up. But I did. And I got to act like a normal worried mother, not an over-the-top this must be cancer obsessed mother. It felt good.And it felt good when the doctor read the MRI right in front of us this morning, sharing that there is no mass. He was not able to share what is causing this mystery eye condition that still must be investigated, but he assured us it's nothing serious, nothing life-threatening, nothing like cancer.Perhaps the fact that my handful of recent health scares have not resulted in malignancies is allowing me to cool my guns a bit, to relax, to realize that not everything comes with a worst-case-scenario result. So maybe -- just maybe -- I am approaching some normalcy in my life, two years after my own worst-case-scenario sent me on the most terrifying ride of my life. Comments: 1.

       " 'I am jingling and jangling with charms around my wrist once again. Ever since I was diagnosed with breast cancer, my friend Nicole has sent me a Brighton breast cancer bracelet. My very first bracelet arrived in 2004, and I wore it proudly. My second bracelet arrived in 2005 and took the place of the first. And now, as I enter my third year of survival, my 2006 Power of Pink bracelet dangles from my arm.This year\\'s bracelet features a heart-shaped locket. Other charms -- designed to represent stepping stones to recovery -- feature key survival terms. Brighton tells it like this -- \"When we accept, we open the door to trust and find love that will heal. Along the way, we learn to be the inspiration.\" And there are still more charms -- a breast cancer awareness ribbon signifying a fight for the cure, a four leaf clover to assure luck is on our side, silver beads for richness, clear crystals for truth and purity. And still, there are more.Brighton recommends we all make a difference in the breast cancer crusade. Some may choose to chip in by contributing financially. Some may volunteer. Some may lend a sympathetic ear to others in need. Some may purchase and wear the 2006 Power of Pink bracelet -- proceeds benefit breast cancer research -- and this one simple act will send an empowering message to women everywhere. Comments: ',\n",
       " 'My sister recently ran into the surgeon who removed my breast cancer tumor almost two years ago -- on December 3, 2004. He asked my sister how I was doing, recalled the unprecedented rash I developed from the latex and Tegaderm tape used during my lumpectomy, and then talked about how terribly busy he has been. This surgeon -- who spends countless clinic hours with women whose breasts are somehow diseased and then spends day after day in operating rooms trying to remedy these diseases -- said he is amazed and at how many breast cancer cases are consuming his time. It\\'s sad -- the amount of women showing up with breast cancer -- but there is a silver lining to this cancer cloud, because according to this surgeon, the vast majority of these breast cancer cases are early stage. This means they were caught swiftly and quickly. And for the women behind these cases, there is a good chance of long-term survival.And so maybe all the pink and all the press surrounding breast cancer is working. Maybe it\\'s inspiring women to pursue self-breast exams, clinical exams, mammography, and other screening options. Maybe all the persistence and passion about breast cancer is the reason for this early detection -- the key to a good prognosis.My surgeon closed his chat with my sister by telling her to call him if anyone in our family ever needs anything. But he told her he hopes he never has to hear from us. My sentiments exactly. Comments: 1. Interesting. But i wouldnt cancer my self. I would be too afraid.2. Interesting article. Question: is the surgeon busier because women are more diligent in detecting the cancer early or are there more cases of breast cancer?

       " \"TIME magazine has faithfully followed the issues defining cancer. The topic has made the covers of many issues, and it receives plentiful press on the pages in between. Stories spotlight an array of different cancers, address research and new developments, and offer personal glimpses into the lives of both everyday survivors and those with celebrity status. A look into the archives of TIME magazine -- seven specific issues -- illustrates a proven commitment to the cancer cause. And it proves the mystery of cancer is much the same today as it was many years ago.   TIME's January 14, 1991 cover read, One American woman in ten will get   breast cancer: Why -- and what can be done? How times have changed.   Almost 16 years later and now one American woman in eight will get breast   cancer. The question Why -- and what can be done? remains.   On April 25, 1994, TIME released a cover that read, Hope in the war   against cancer. An article reveals that scientists may have reached a   turning point with new discoveries and better therapies. The turns are endless   -- and while we have certainly reached breakthrough status in the 12 years   since this cover first appeared, there are so many more corners to turn.    May 19, 1998 saw the cover story How to tell the hype from the   hope -- a special report topic that reminds us all to really consider   every piece of information we gather on the topic of cancer. A 93 percent   survival rate for a breast cancer patient with an early form of the disease   might seem hopeful -- but this survival rate is for only five years. Not so   hopeful.   There is new ammunition in the war against cancer: These are the   bullets. This cover hit newsstands on May 28, 2001 and referred to drugs   that target cancer cells only and leave healthy cells untouched. Is this   the breakthrough we've been waiting for? was published on this cover.   Yes, I think it is. And the promise continues with more and more targeted   therapies.   On February 18, 2002, breast cancer graced the cover again --   fitting for a cancer that gets a lot of attention. The cover title The new   thinking on breast cancer led into a story about the smartest drugs, the   gentlest treatments, the latest on mammograms.   A story in the June 21, 2004 issue titled Surviving Cancer   addressed again the issue of targeted therapies and threw out there the   possibility that cancer might just be a chronic condition that can be managed   throughout life. More and more, this possibility seems possible.   A new old therapy appeared in the January 9, 2006 magazine and   revealed that injecting chemotherapy directly into the abdominal cavity can   extend life expectancy by 16 months for terminal ovarian cancer patients.   Ovarian cancer is often deadly due to a lack of adequate screening and late   diagnoses -- so this revelation was quite remarkable. Reflecting on past issues of TIME magazine is eye-opening. It reveals comprehensive coverage of a comprehensive disease. It shows just how far we've come in the war on cancer -- and just how far we have to go. A lot has changed over the years. And a lot has remained the same. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'All cancers are not treated equally. Some attract a frenzy of attention -- breast cancer -- and some receive not much attention at all -- gallbladder cancer. Some are vigorously researched and studied. Others sit by idly, rarely the subject of investigation. Some are feverishly funded. Some never prosper by way of financial support. Yet they all share something very important in common. They are all cancer. All cancers are marked by an uncontrollable division and spread of abnormal cells. And they are all capable of delivering shock and despair and even death to any one of us. And that makes each one -- brain cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, eye cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, stomach cancer, you name it -- worthy of equal attention.And so I bring to you Cancer by the Numbers, a series of posts that will feature the basics about all sorts of cancer, beginning with the numbers -- the statistics -- to help define the prevalence of each cancer, followed by important facts about screening, diagnosis, treatment, survival, and more. I will cover the well-known cancers, the sort-of-known cancers, the barely-known cancers. And while I can only offer what I can track down on each form of cancer, I intend to dish out every piece of data I can dig up -- so we all can become a little more informed, a little more prepared should we have to personally do battle with any one of the 100 possible cancers out there.The American Cancer Society reports that 1,399,790 new cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2006. This estimate does not include most carcinoma in situ (noninvasive cancer) cases and also does take into account the estimated one million cases of basal and squamous cell skin cancers that will be diagnosed this year. Of these predicted cases, about 564,830 will result in death -- that\\'s more than 1,500 people each day. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease, and accounts for one of every four deaths.These numbers are staggering. But without further explanation, they are broad and all-encompassing and don\\'t say much about how all the individual diseases add up. That\\'s what I plan to do -- break it all down, cancer by cancer, until the numbers make sense. And the cancers do too. Comments: 1. I definitely agree that all cancer are not treated equally. All i hear or read is mostly breast cancer. I have a Metastatic Rhabdomyosarcoma \"cancer of the soft tissue\" and I know for so long that there\\'s something wrong but Dr.\\'s didn\\'t find anything until I have a spinal chord compressor ,cancer already spread. They give me blood test every month and I\\'m anemic for so long , but all i hear is \"there\\'s nothing wrong\". I still have a lot of unanswered question, thanks for the internet and Redtoenail site, i\\'ve learned a lot. 2. Thank you for doing this series.',\n",
       " 'Testicular cancer, cancer in one or both of the testicles, usually occurs in young men and will strike about 8,250 of these men this year. About 370 men will die. A man\\'s lifetime risk of developing this cancer -- that typically shows up in only one testicle -- is 1 in 300, securing it as one of the less common cancers in the United States. The chances of dying from testicular cancer are 1 in 5,000, making it one of the most curable forms of cancer. Yet it is still the most common form of cancer in men ages 15-34. It is also a cancer commonly characterized by denial and embarrassment. As a result, it is one of the least mentioned cancers.Warning signs of testicular cancer -- a disease of unknown cause -- include a lump or enlargement in either testicle, a heavy feeling in the scrotum, a dull ache in the abdomen or groin, a sudden collection of fluid in the scrotum, pain or discomfort in a testicle or scrotum, enlargement or tenderness of the breasts, and unexplained fatigue and general unwell feelings. Possible risk factors for this cancer include age, family history, HIV infection, an undescended testicle -- even when surgically relocated -- and personal history of previous testicular cancer. Any and all signs, symptoms, and relevant history should be reported to a physician.Most men detect testicular cancer themselves, either by accident or via self-examination. Ultrasound typically follows the discovery of a concern and a biopsy, in the form of a small incision in the groin area, can confirm the presence of cancerous cells. A finding of cancer usually mandates the removal of the testicle. Various blood and imaging tests can detect the spread of the disease.Testicular cancer, a disease with famous survivors that include cyclist Lance Armstrong; Canadian comedian Tom Green; and figure skater Scott Hamilton, is most common among white men and is classified as one of two types -- seminoma, a slow-growing cancer occurring in men ranging in age from late 30s to early 50s and almost always curable and non-seminoma, a fast-growing cancer of various forms that can metastasize and occurs primarily in younger men.Like other cancers, testicular cancers are staged. Stage I testicular cancer refers to cancer confined to the testicle. Stage II cancer has spread to the lymph nodes in the abdomen. And Stage III has spread to other regions of the body, such as lungs and liver.Treatment for testicular cancer includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and in rare cases when chemotherapy is not effective, bone marrow transplant. Some men may also choose testicular implant surgery following treatment.Men who are concerned about their fertility as a result of testicular cancer should talk with their physicians prior to surgery and treatment about preserving sperm through freezing and storage. Cryopreserved sperm can be used later in life.Resources for people affected by testicular cancer are plentiful and serve as the sources of the information in this post. They include the Mayo Clinic, the American Cancer Society, Testicular Cancer Support Forums, MedlinePlus, and People Living With Cancer.

I know someone who has been having on and off swelling in the groin area. Actually this person has complained of swollen testicles accompanied with pain.

       " 'Twenty years from now, no one will die of cancer and heart disease, according to an expert in Perth, who believes advances in genetic technology will one day leave death by cancer in the dust.Professor John Shine, director of the Garvan Institute for Medical Research in Sydney, says people will still get cancer -- they just won\\'t die from it. He shared last week at a genetics conference in Perth, \"I think there\\'s no doubt death from cancer will be confined to the annals of history, And I think a very similar thing will apply to heart disease.\"Despite reservations from some about genetic technology, Shine believes the desire to combat cancer -- once and for all -- will prevail over political opinion. And so that leaves only technical obstacles in the way. It\\'s just a matter of time before these scientific hurdles are no longer issues.Shine, known as the father of cloning, pioneered gene research in the 1970s when he identified the genes for insulin and the human growth hormone. Comments: 1. Many people still die because of this terrible disease. The fact that specialists appreciate that in 20 years\\' time no one will die because of cancer is a hope. Maybe the period of time will be shorter.2. One group leading the search for cures for cancer is the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), with tens of thousands of researchers and researcher/clinicians as members, about 17,000 of whom attended last April\\'s national conference in Washington, DC.The AACR has a wonderful program for cancer survivors and advocates, known as the Scientist-Survivor Program. The concept is that survivors and advocates in the program learn from the scientists and in turn inform the scientists about the patients\\' experiences and put a human face on the disease. Essentially, those selected in a competitive process attend the national conference, then write about the experience to their constituencies. I have been selected the past two years and am applying for a third year (final eligibility). The experience is extremely valuable, and we are treated like royalty. The SSP schedule includes many talks by top conference speakers just to our small SSP group, and delivered in layman\\'s language (more or less). My own rather long reports of my own experiences in 2005 and 2006 are available at www.vapcacoalition.org in the Electronic Documents Section (\"Your Man at the AACR 2005, 2006\"). (My impression is that most of us write considerably shorter reports, but brevity is not my long suit. The reports do describe what it feels like as a participant.)Those interested in applying have more than a week to do so (including letter of recommendation) before the November 17 deadline. (The application takes some work and is not something to be left to the last minute.) You can read more about the program and download the online application at <A href=\"http://www.aacr.org/home/survivors--advocates/scientistharr;survivor-program.aspx\" rel=nofollow>http://www.aacr.org/home/survivors--advocates/scientistharr;survivor-program.aspx</A>. My impression is that about 50% of applicants are selected each year. The SSP is looking for survivors and advocates who are active in learning about their cancer (or cancer generally) and passing on the information, as well as serving as advocates for the cancer community. Our blog authors would be ideal candidates, but most of us are not nearly so active and involved.Jim Waldenfels3. A couple more key details: the annual conference is from April 14-18, 2007 at the Los Angeles Convention Center.The SSP pays basically all expenses (travel and living expenses, etc. minus some personal expenses).Jim',\n",
       " 'He an unlikely breast cancer survivor -- because he is a man. But still he developed the disease that roughly 1,700 men will contract this year. And while that statistics pertaining to women and men with breast cancer differ -- women are 100 times more likely to get the disease -- the biology of the disease is exactly the same. Under the microscope, breast cancer is breast cancer. It does not behave any differently in female and male bodies. And detection, treatment, and survival rates are nearly identical for both sexes.Bob Riter, 49, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996. Now in remission, he works as the associate director of the Ithaca Breast Cancer Alliance in New York where he speaks out and educates the public about this widespread disease. He believes his personal story, with its different twist, prompts people to really listen.Riter\\'s audiences learn that breast cancer in men usually presents itself as a lump in the chest, dimpling of the skin, or changes in the nipple. Doctors can perform breast exams, mammography, and biopsy to investigate the possibility of the cancer that typically strikes men between the ages of 60 and 70. Treatment includes mastectomy to remove the tumor and surrounding lymph nodes, chemotherapy, radiation, and hormone therapy.It was the presence of blood coming from his nipple that sent Riter to his doctor -- and then to a surgeon who declared a diagnosis of breast cancer. Riter is somewhat of an exception because he reported to his doctor immediately. Most men do not. Many do not even realize they are at risk of breast cancer so they ignore symptoms. They also may go underground with their suspicions of breast cancer because of embarrassment. Both can lead to diagnoses of more advanced diseases.Riter is doing his part to enlighten both men and women that men are not immune to breast cancer, that they should be active in monitoring their breast health. \"I really like to go to national breast cancer meetings,\" he says, \"because a lot of people know that men get breast cancer in theory, but until you have a face to associate with it, it\\'s fairly abstract. And so I\\'m sort of that face.\" Comments: 1. As a man who is also a breast cancor survivor, as is mr Riter, I see the surprise in peoples faces when I say I have breast cancer. I think that it is important for me to tell people about my cancer to help raise awareness of breast cancer in men.It may be only a small percentage of breast cancers, but it is as important to the men who have it as it is to the women so diagnosed.',\n",
       " 'On Sunday, for the very first time, I read a magazine article about the hospital where I received treatment for breast cancer. I had never before seen mention of my hospital, my doctors, my city in anything other than local and regional newspapers and on area television stations. I figured news about Shands Hospital at The University of Florida was out there -- in more areas than my own -- because it\\'s a well-known facility. People travel from all over to receive treatment here. So I know it\\'s a good place. But to see in the October 2006 issue of Good Housekeeping an actual blurb about a new kind of lumpectomy -- pioneered right here in Gainesville, Florida -- is exciting.I am the happy recipient of this new kind of lumpectomy -- which really is not new at all. It was developed 20 years ago by the surgeon who performed my own lumpectomy, and it allows women who undergo lumpectomy the chance to avoid return trips to the operating room.The method is called frozen section analysis, and it was first used by Dr. Edward Copland III, first director of the UF Shands Cancer Center, who was tired of waiting for pathology reports and tired of operating on patients two and three times to ensure clear tumor margins.It all happens like this -- a surgeon removes the breast cancer tumor, takes tissue samples, freezes them in an embedding compound, and sends them to a pathologist for immediate analysis. In a typical case, this frozen section process adds just 15 minutes to the operating time. If pathology reveals more tissue must be removed, the surgeon returns to the patient, still under anesthesia, and continues surgery. The patient does not need to return for more surgery.Surgeons at most institutions rely on a method called permanent section analysis to determine whether or not cancerous cells remain along the margins of a tumor. The technique is labor-intensive, takes days to complete, and requires patients to return for additional surgery if margins are not clear. Surgeons using the frozen section method still consult permanent sections to confirm margins are clear -- but they are mostly certain of their findings during frozen section.Studies show frozen section analysis to be safe and effective -- and it adds just $851 to the cost of surgery, a savings considering the cost of returning for surgery as a result of permanent analysis. There are many advantages -- but the procedure is tricky and on occasion can fail to detect some cancerous margins, indicating frozen section should continue to be used in conjunction with permanent section. Opponents of the practice say false positives could result in unnecessary mastectomy. But Copeland says this has never happened at UF -- and he would never remove a woman\\'s breasts until permanent section confirmed it was necessary.Despite the promise of this method, only a handful of institutions make practice of this surgery-sparing technique. Shands at UF is the only hospital in North Florida where breast surgeons perform frozen section analysis on a regular basis.The procedure -- which is not risky, is not harmful, and clearly saves patients from returning for surgery -- is the exact procedure I received almost two years ago. Dr. Copeland removed my tumor, froze tissue samples, sent them to pathology, and 15 minutes later knew my tumor had clear margins and had not spread to my lymph nodes. He visited my family in the hospital waiting room just after surgery and told them the good news -- clear margins, no spread, a 1.1 cm. tumor, stage I. And while other tumor criteria, such as ER/PR status and HER2 status, did not come my way immediately, I at least knew the basics when I woke from surgery. No waiting. No worrying. No complaints. Comments: 1. I\\'m not sure I understand your post. A few points from a practicing surgical pathologist (the guy who does the frozen sections):1. The frozen section technique -- the proper name is intra-operative pathology consultation -- is old, dating from the 60\\'s. Since the 80\\'s, the Mayo clinic pathologists use this technique extensively and boast to be able to produce a final pathology report before the patient wakes up.2. The tumorectomy specimen is removed by the surgeon, immediately sent to the pathologist who paints it with india ink, cuts it and visually selects areas to be examined by cryosection histology (\"frozen section\"). The actual frozen section procedure is technically difficult. It is done in the laboratory by specialized technologists, and takes about 10 minutes. After examination of the resulting histology slides, the intraoperative report of the pathologist to the surgeon is very brief, traditionally shouted via an intercom. An example would be \"malignant, margins clear\". 4. You probably describe one variant of the procedure where the surgeon, after removal of the tumour, takes multiple small samples (biopsies) of the surgical cavity and sends them to the pathology laboratory. Hence, it is the surgeon who visually selects areas to be examined by frozen section. In any case, the procedure is done in the laboratory, not in the operating room.3. In the 80\\'s, tumorectomy became the standard of care for breast cancer. Intraoperative evaluation of surgical margins was recommended for all tumorectomies. In practice, the surgeon decides and frozen section is done on about half the cases. 4. I am not surprised to hear that women\\'s magazines seldom discuss frozen sections. I would not draw conclusions from this. Emmanuel Maicas, MD, Pathologist, Moncton, Canada2. Dear Readers,In response to the comment left by Emmanuel: I have written to him and asked what he finds hard to understand. I plan to clarify anything that might make my post difficult to comprehend. I believe what Emmanuel writes is very similar to what I write really, except that he adds some technical jargon and terms that I did not include. My intention was to summarize the procedure, not scientifically dissect it. I hope this is what I did, without inaccuracy.Sincerely,Jacki DonaldsonThe Cancer Blog3. how can i find out more? can i e-mail/call jacki donaldson directly? i need to know if this method is remotely possible with multiple tumors in one breast.thank you4. This is the first time I heard of this procedure. Well, if it saves time and money then it\\'s ok. But as you mentioned, sometimes there are false positive results. Or sometimes it fails to detect cancerous margins. I know how horrible it must be to have surgery more than once. But if it that\\'s what it takes to be safe and sure then by all means. ',\n",
       " 'In 2006, 174,470 people will be diagnosed with lung cancer in the United States. About 92,700 men and 81,770 women will develop the disease -- the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women. An estimated 162,460 men and women will die of lung cancer this year, accounting for 28 percent of all cancer deaths and taking more lives than colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. While most people diagnosed with lung cancer will die within the first two years of diagnosis -- this has not changed in 10 years -- some people are cured. There are currently about 333,000 long-term survivors. Lung cancer -- the most preventable of all cancers -- typically occurs in the elderly. Nearly 70 percent of people diagnosed with the disease are older than 65. Fewer than three percent are under the age of 45.Lung cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in one or both lungs. While normal healthy tissue cells reproduce and develop into healthy lung tissue, abnormal cells reproduce rapidly and never grow into normal lung tissue. Lumps of cancer tissue -- tumors -- then form and disrupt the function of the lung.There are two different types of lung cancer. Small-cell lung cancers make up one quarter of all cases. This cancer grows fast and quickly spreads to other organs. Non-small-cell lung cancer -- squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma -- is the most common type of lung cancer.A diagnosis of lung cancer typically results because a growing tumor causes symptoms to appear -- symptoms like a persistent cough, constant chest pain, shortness of breath, wheezing, hoarseness, recurring pneumonia or bronchitis, coughing up blood, unexplained fatigue, swelling and redness of the neck and face, and loss of appetite and weight. By the time these symptoms surface, the cancer cannot be easily cured. Additional symptoms -- bone pain, numbness in arms and legs, dizziness and seizure, yellowing of skin and eyes, and masses near the surface of the skin -- may indicate the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Early detection is just not possible with lung cancer since symptoms do not appear until the disease is advanced and while a recent controversial study suggests computerized chest scans may work for screening smokers for the disease, diagnosis typically comes too late for long-term survival. So prevention is key and because more than 87 percent of all lung cancer cases are smoking-related, eliminating tobacco use is critical for preventing diagnoses of lung cancer.Diagnosis of lung cancer typically occurs with chest x-rays, spiral CT scans, MRI, PET scans, and bone scans -- which also help stage the disease. Staging for non-small-cell lung cancer ranges from stage 0 to IV. Staging for small-cell lung cancer is classified as either limited or extensive.Each type of lung cancer is treated differently but both are treated with a combination of surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. New advances -- such as phytodynamic therapy and biologic therapy -- may one day be standard treatment as well. Lung cancer -- responsible for the recent deaths of Peter Jennings and Dana Reeves -- will receive special attention this month as November is National Lung Cancer Awareness Month.

       " 'I was hospitalized twice last year for chemo-induced fever and low blood counts. My first stay came at a busy time -- the hospital\\'s oncology floor was full and there was no space for me. So I was admitted to the bone marrow transplant unit as an overflow patient and suddenly -- even in my very sick and compromised state -- I became the healthiest person on the floor. My white blood count was 700 -- sounded pretty bad to me -- but some of the patients staying on this floor with me had no blood counts because in order to receive a transplant, their own bone marrow is completely depleted in order to prepare for new bone marrow. Patients on this floor are considered pretty healthy when their counts reach 500. I was considered sick and was hospitalized at 700. Adults and children on this floor stay in rooms behind glass panels and with special -- and loud -- air flow systems that push germs out of the room. Visitors must wear gowns and shoe covers and must wash their hands before entering the rooms. Patients might stay on this floor for months at a time, receiving chemotherapy and preparing for their eventual bone marrow transplants. Some patient rooms are decorated and arranged just like home. Parents prepare rooms for children with play areas and craft areas and television areas. This floor is home to many sick children -- and this is what affected me most. For my five days on the bone marrow transplant unit, I gained an up-close and personal look at what many parents and children encounter when cancer derails their lives. It was so much more than I had to encounter. It must be quite an undertaking to prepare a child for this experience.I picked up a coloring book the day I was discharged and walked off this floor and back into my own life. It\\'s a coloring book that comes from The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society and is made by bone marrow transplant patients for children preparing for their own transplants. There is a poster for children to color and hang on their hospital room walls that says I Will Get Well, there is a page that terms chemo and radiation as Laser Rays and Guard Dogs and pages that help children visualize happy moments -- like playing a favorite sport or activity and jumping rope in the warm sunshine. This book reminds children that it is okay to cry and it even includes a prescription: Make sure you get at least one hug every day!The overall message of this coloring book, which is stated in writing is, \"A good attitude does not mean being cheerful all the time; it just means that you know that this is necessary to help fight your cancer.\"&nbsp; Well said.

       " \"Journalist, commentator, and cancer patient Leroy Sievers -- the guy we've written about before, the guy who has covered many wars and witnessed countless deaths, the guy who is now observing his own death as cancer in his lungs and spine chip away at his life -- has realized that getting good news takes some getting used to. Sievers got some good news recently. He learned that the new combination of chemotherapy drugs he's been receiving has shrunk the tumors in his lungs. And scans show the tumor on his spine is healing. It's taken him days to truly understand this concept -- this concept of hope that has miraculously delivered him more time. He didn't expect it. Sievers fully expected that he would soon be dead. That's why he's been savoring the cold, crisp fall days -- because he was not certain he would ever see such a season. He was sure he would never host another Halloween party either -- a party he canceled this year due to his health. But now, as he takes in this new sensation of hope, he considers the possibility he may be around for another party. And he thinks he'll dress up as a tumor. Halloween is one time when good taste is never important, he says.Sievers, who offers a weekly personal health update for NPR, available in print or in podcast format on his blog, plans to keep living in the moment. He doesn't want to overdo this hope thing. So right now, he is simply enjoying the colorful leaves -- and the season he calls one of his favorites. Comments: 1. It is truly miraculous. I cannot imagine how it must feel to know of your impending death. And I cannot imagine the joy that one would feel knowing he has ben given anothre chance in life. I hope that this not just buying him time. I sincerely hope that he is cured of all cancer and that this is a chance for others as well. \",\n",

All of it. The throat. The gums. The lymph nodes. The fever blister. Nothing more. Should last five to seven days. Don't worry. Relax. Call if it gets worse.Feeling better. Feeling emotional. Because people are so kind. Like my dentist. Who eased my mind. Soothed my soul. Time to march forward. For myself. For today. Comments: 1. What kind of virus is that? This looks like a poem. Never really read a poem about chemotherapy before. Anyway, it's a little depressing. Even more sad is the fact that many people have to go throught this. And yet there is no guarantee that it will work.\",\n",
       " \"In the not-too-distant future, dermatologists will be able to diagnose skin cancer without ever cutting the skin. Right now, doctors cut out all suspicious lesions in order to examine them, to determine if they are cancerous or not. But with the development of a new microscope, cells can be examined right on the body -- without cutting.Moles matter, reported Matt Lauer on Thursday's TODAY show during an interview with a skin cancer expert. Moles are highly associated with melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. So it is critical that each mole is investigated. With this new high resolution technology -- essentially a video biopsy -- a camera will allow doctors to view cells, zero in on the area of concern, and pinpoint the exact cells that make up a mole. If the cells are similar in shape and size and have equal distribution, the mole is normal. If the individual cells are irregular and have no uniform pattern, the mole is abnormal and probably cancerous.While cutting for biopsy purposes will one day be a thing of the past, cutting will still be necessary if a mole is characterized by cancerous cells. If it's cancer, it must come out. But the video biopsy can be used to map the border and boundaries and will allow for precise removal of the mole.This technology is still developing -- but one day, perhaps eight to 10 years from now -- doctors will be able to more consistently detect cancer without removal of skin. For now, they must take a piece of the mole and put it under a microscope.There are definite warning signs of skin cancer. Any mole that is asymmetrical with irregular borders and varied, dark colors should be reported to a physician. Also, any mole that changes in color, shape, or size and is bigger than a pencil eraser is cause for concern. Comments: \",\n",

       " \"I will visit my oncologist on Monday for my every-three-month check-up. It's the recurring appointment that will appear on my calendar until I hit the five-year-survival milestone. I am three years away. It's the appointment that consumes at least half of my day due to endless waiting -- waiting for a parking spot, waiting in the lobby, waiting in the exam room, waiting to pay. It's the appointment that officially begins with the drawing of my blood for lab work, continues with a check of my vitals, proceeds with a history review and physical exam with a medical student. It's the appointment that brings me face to face with the man who prescribed my treatment, the man who offers me strategies for living beyond treatment, the man who helps keep me alive. My oncologist.And so I am preparing for this visit in the same exact way as I always do. I set aside a large chunk of time for this time-consuming extravaganza. I think a lot about the lab work and wonder if something suspicious will surface. I think a lot about the physical exam and wonder if an enlarged lymph node or mass in my breast will be discovered. And I think a lot about what I want to ask -- because this is my only very own allotted time for unraveling the mysteries of cancer with the man who knows the topic like no one else I know.On Monday, I will ask a few questions. I will ask about tumor markers, about why I am not tested for these indicators of tumor growth, a standard option for my co-writer and co-cancer survivor Kristina Collins. I will ask about Zoloft, about how long I should continue taking this anti-depressant and how to best wean myself from this drug when the time comes. I will ask about the flu shot, about whether or not I can get one during this same appointment. And that's all. For now. Until three more months pass and my calendar tells me it's time to return for this recurring appointment that takes me closer to the five-year mark. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"I love it when seven of something lands before me, offering me potential material for the Sunday Seven series. In fact, it just happened. And I can't wait to start writing about the Seven Levels of Healing common to cancer patients and those who love them.I have a new book. It's called The Journey Through Cancer: Healing and Transforming the Whole Person by Jeremy Geffen, MD. Dr. Geffen knows cancer. He lost his father just three months after a stomach cancer diagnosis. He became an oncologist. He founded a cancer research center. He travels and speaks and writes about health and wellness. And inside the pages of his newly revised and updated paperback, he details the Seven Levels of Healing -- a blend of conventional and complementary principles-- and the true stories of cancer patients who have directly experienced them.It occurred to me while first flipping through this book that I might read it in its entirety and then write a review of the material. Then I determined it would take much too long for this approach. With two small children, a few jobs, an exercise routine I must revisit, and all the other bits and pieces of life that keep me occupied, this would be quite an undertaking -- the actual reading, the remembering, the writing. Somehow, this would be too much to manage. But small steps. I think I can handle small steps. So this is how it's going to work.I will present to you in this post the Seven Levels of Healing. I don't know much about them yet -- although by title alone, I am sure I have lived most of them in my own cancer journey. So I will simply lay the groundwork. And then I will start reading. And as I read, I will write. This will be my own one-woman book club -- with an open invitation for new members. Read my posts and reflect on them. Agree. Disagree. Leave comments. Buy your own book. Read with me. Apply what you learn to your own life. Share what you learn with others. The possibilities are endless as I journey my way through this new book in search of peace, clarity, and comfort -- all of which flow from these seven levels.Level One: Education &amp; InformationLevel Two: Connection with OthersLevel Three: The Body as GardenLevel Four: Emotional HealingLevel Five: The Nature of MindLevel Six: Life AssessmentLevel Seven: The Nature of SpiritAnd so that's what I have to offer for now. I'm sorry to keep you hanging. But rest assured, I am hanging right along with you, eager to find a moment to dive into this book. To sink my teeth into the words, sentences, paragraphs, chapters. To relay it all to you. I can't wait -- to really understand the Seven Levels of Healing.Stay tuned for:The Journey Through Cancer: Introduction Comments: 1. That's a great list! Number 2, connections with others, is extra important. Cancer can be so isolating, especially for men who frequently think that as males they are supposed to go it alone and contain their feelings. When I went through my cancer (thyroid) there was much less info on the web, and I couldn't find a viable support group (and felt bad that I was looking for one). If any cancer guys are reading this, don't wait to make the connections with other people. It makes steering through the process a lot easier.Regards,Richard Day Gore2. Unfortunately, Geffin's book has nothing of relevance for the gay or lesbian patient. People seem to forget that gay and lesbian cancer patients have unique psycho social needs.\",\n",
       " \"My mom's best friend died from pancreatic cancer just three months after her diagnosis with the disease. One of my co-workers lost her mother to the same disease just weeks after diagnosis. Another co-worker's husband lost his battle with pancreatic cancer after a 15-month all-out fight. And a family friend has somehow been surviving this deadly disease for years now. He's the exception, defying the odds rarely in favor of long-term survival.About 33,730 people will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2006. Many of them -- 32,300 -- will die from the disease that is rarely caught early. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in the United States.By the time a person exhibits symptoms of pancreatic cancer, the cancer has typically reached an unmanageable size and has spread to other organs. And because the pancreas is deep inside the body, doctors cannot see or feel tumors during routine exams. There are no blood tests that detect this cancer, and tumor marker tests often do not show indications of the disease until the cancer is advanced.Symptoms that can signal pancreatic cancer include jaundice -- a yellowing of the skin and eyes -- that is present in about half of all people with the disease, belly and back pain, weight loss, digestive problems, swelling of the gallbladder, blood clots, and onset of diabetes.Symptoms that cause alarm will prompt testing to determine whether or not cancer is present. An abdominal physical exam and various imaging tests -- CT scan, PET scan, ultrasound, and MRI -- will occur in combination with endoscopy to scope the pathway between the throat and small intestine and angiography to examine blood vessels. And while all this testing will provide clues, biopsy of the pancreatic tumor is the only sure-fire way to confirm cancer. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) and laproscopy are the common biopsy approaches. Most doctors try to avoid surgical biopsy unless it looks like an operation is necessary to remove the cancer. Although sadly, doctors often begin surgery only to find the cancer has spread too far for removal. In this event, a sample is taken and the surgery is stopped.Most doctors prefer to stage pancreatic cancer as follows: resectable, indicating the cancer is only in the pancreas and can be surgically removed, locally advanced/unresectable, indicating the cancer has spread to the surrounding tissue but not to other organs, and metastatic, indicating the disease has spread to distant organs.When applicable, surgery is the first line of treatment. Radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy often follow.There is no way to prevent pancreatic cancer -- although there are certain risk factors that can loosely predict onset of the disease. The risk of this cancer increases with age, and 90 percent of patients are older than 55. Men, African-Americans, smokers, diabetics, people with chronic pancreatitis, the obese, and those with a family history of pancreatic cancer tend to be at highest risk. There is some concern that consistent contact with certain chemicals -- such as bug sprays, dyes, or gasoline products -- raise risk. And a diet marked by high red meat consumption may pose some danger.Pancreatic cancer statistics are grim -- but they are just statistics, just numbers. And any one of us has a chance of beating the odds. My family friend is doing it, living long after his pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Apple CEO Steve Jobs -- diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2004 -- is doing it, surviving a form of the disease curable with surgery. Miracles happen every day.For more information about pancreatic cancer, visit the following sites -- where the content of this post was gathered.American Cancer SocietyMedline PlusNational Cancer InstituteNational Pancreas Foundation Comments: 1.

       " 'It was his father\\'s death from stomach cancer -- and the cold, impersonal, clinical manner in which his father was treated leading up to his death -- that inspired Dr. Jeremy Geffen to become the kind of oncologist he wished had been available for his father -- \"someone who could look into the mind, heart, and spirit of a human being as intently as he could gaze at an MRI scan or pathology report; someone who provided love, support, wisdom, and hope.\"For the 20 years that have followed his father\\'s death, Geffen\\'s inspiration has led him in exactly this direction. He credits education and a strong network of mentors for preparing him for the path less traveled, for allowing him to achieve his vision for comprehensive, integrative medical care.Geffen founded the Geffen Cancer Center and Research Institute in 1994, and directed it until 2003. It was one of the first cancer centers in the United States created specifically to provide complete, holistic care for people with cancer and their loved ones.After working closely with cancer patients over the years, Geffen observed that every single question and concern encountered on the journey through cancer falls precisely into one of seven different yet interrelated domains.Geffen wrote down these domains -- he calls them the Seven Levels of Healing -- and began sharing them with his patients and staff who remarked that the levels perfectly mirrored their own experiences. And so Geffen kept them fresh in his mind and over the course of time developed them into a formal program that became the foundation for the standard of care offered to his patients and their loved ones.Geffen\\'s book -- that brings life to the Seven Levels of Healing -- is called The Journey Through Cancer: Healing and Transforming the Whole Person. It is a result of his own personal journey that began the day his father left a dreaded string of words on his answering machine. \"Oh, Jeremy. I think I\\'ve got a little problem. I had an endoscopy today and the doctor said I have a tumor in my stomach. Unfortunately, it\\'s malignant. Maybe you could give me a call.\" Geffen was in medical school when his father recorded these words. Now he is an accomplished oncologist, author, public speaker. He is the father of the Seven Levels of Healing -- soon to be revealed right here on The Cancer Blog.To read previous post on the same topic, visit:Sunday Seven: Seven Levels of Healing on Cancer JourneyStay tuned for:The Journey Through Cancer: What Is The Purpose of Medicine?

       " 'Someone once told me to think of cancer as a chronic condition -- an illness like diabetes or asthma that may linger for life and may require continual treatment. And while battling cancer, perhaps for life, I should just hope that medical advances occur and new treatments become available. And maybe, just maybe, the science of medicine will decrease by leaps and bounds the number of people who die from cancer.During my own battle with cancer -- which has been 18 months long -- two new breast cancer drugs have hit the scene with rave reviews from researchers and medical professionals. This is good news for me because my type of breast cancer makes me a candidate for both drugs. Herceptin is one of these drugs -- given to women who are HER-2/neu positive -- that\\'s me -- and over express a protein that makes the tumor aggressive. Herceptin is received over 52 weeks -- and I go every three weeks for a 90-minute infusion of this clear liquid that causes me really no side effects at all. It can be toxic to the heart but monitoring tests have revealed that my heart is not suffering at this time. And with just three more infusions to go -- one this Wednesday -- I will likely encounter no adverse reactions to this potentially life-saving drug. And now Tykerb is making headlines. Tykerb, suggested for use with advanced breast cancer and manufactured by British-based GlaxoSmithKline PLC, is an experimental drug that delays the growth of tumors nearly twice as long as standard chemotherapy in patients who no longer respond to Herceptin. This finding, reported this past Saturday at a meeting in Atlanta of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, confirms initial findings about the promise of this drug -- that like Herceptin, made by Genentech, precisely targets tumors without killing lots of healthy cells. The difference between the two drugs is that Herceptin blocks the protein on the cell\\'s surface and Tykerb does it inside the cell -- blocking a second abnormal protein too. And while Herceptin is given intravenously, Tykerb is given in pill form -- which may make it cheaper and easier to use. While now part of an international study, Tykerb may be available to women in the United States later this year. And it perhaps will be offered in conjunction with Herceptin or instead of Herceptin for women with advanced breast cancer.I hope I do not ever need Tykerb -- and that Herceptin alone will be enough for me -- but it is comforting to know that there is something else out there. Something that if necessary, just might help me live with this potentially chronic condition called cancer. Comments: 1. Great Post JackiI think we still need to \"wait and see\" while tykerb finds its own little niche - but it certainly bodes well for future similar developments.I\\'ve written about tykerb too - and expanded my thoughts on some related issues on www.twinkletwinkles.comGordon',\n",

And for one more week, participating Panera Bread locations will continue offering the October special -- the Pink Ribbon Bagel. The Pink Ribbon Bagel is not actually pink. But it's in the shape of the breast cancer ribbon. And it contains cherry chips, dried cherries, and cranberries -- yummy -- that give it a pinkish glow.

       " 'I was doing fine at my every-three-month oncologist appointment yesterday. I kept my composure while telling my doctor all about my friend Amy who passed away just one month ago, after a short 15-month battle with breast cancer, at the tender age of 35. As I detailed the story about how Amy\\'s cancer spread to her brain and lungs, how she was given just two to 12 months to live, how she didn\\'t even survive for two months, I saw in his eyes that he knew exactly why I had hand-picked this story just for him. He knew I was trying to determine my own risk for this same outcome -- and so he was understanding and compassionate and comforting in a medical sort of way. And he was convincing -- when he told me he predicts I will absolutely not follow Amy\\'s same path. I did just fine for our whole exchange. Until this same man shifted from medical speak and asked me the four simple words that never fail to trigger a trail of unstoppable tears. \"How are you doing?\" he asked. He caught me off guard. I\\'m not sure I was prepared to dive beyond the surface of my emotions, to reveal my true fear of death from the same disease Amy was sure would not kill her. So I cried. And cried. A medical student fetched me a tissue, my doctor stood and touched my shoulder, and my three-year-old Danny watched with concern. I told everyone I was fine -- mostly, I am -- and I dried my tears. Before departing, my doctor hugged me and told me he\\'d send in a nurse to give me a flu shot.Danny thought I cried because I was scared of the flu shot. Had it not been for his own appointment later in the day for the same flu shot, I would have let him believe this was the cause of my tears. Instead, I told him I was sad for a friend who was sick. And he was happy -- until a sharp needle pierced the skin of his little leg hours later.Danny is happy once again. And I am happy too. My appointment revealed nothing suspicious, nothing worrisome, nothing except the fact that my oncologist thinks of me not just as a case, a statistic, a body that once harbored a disease. He thinks of me as a whole person. And that -- more than anything -- is what makes me cry. Comments: 1. Once again you\\'ve hit the nail on the head. I understand exactly how you feel and am struggling with the same kinds of feelings. I will start to cry at the strangest things. Yesterday I brought my 13 year old daughter with me when I had to have blood taken at the hospital lab. Once again the technician had trouble finding a vein that was usable. This has happened before as I only have one usable arm for any and all proceedures and I\\'ve always just dealt with it without too much of an emotional response. Yesterday however, a second tech was called over to try, they switched to the tiny baby needle and she looked me in the eye and said to me \"oh girl, how are you doing?\" I just started to cry and my baby girl went rooting thru my purse for a kleenex as my blood finally filled the vial. When she asked me later what was wrong I told her that my arm was just sore. Although this is true, my tears really were about so much more. Today is my last chemo treatment and I am hoping to hold it together when the very caring and sweet nurses ask me \"how are you doing?\" and I really do know that they really do care and are never just going thru the motions.',\n",
       " 'My own oncologist did it just two days ago. He checked in on my mental health, asked how I was surviving, and eased my fear of cancer recurrence and possible death. He reached beyond the medical scope of our relationship -- literally. He placed a hand on my shoulder. He offered me a hug. He cared. Yet many doctors refrain from reaching too far into the lives of the patients they treat. They stay at a distance. They focus on merely replacing illness with health. This is, after all, the purpose of medicine -- to fix people.Dr. Jeremy Geffen, author of The Journey Through Cancer: Healing and Transforming the Whole Person, shares in his book that \"at present, doctors focus primarily on the physical characteristics of their patients -- bones and organs, tissue samples, test results, height, weight, and age. Yet in each of us, there is a rich mental, emotional, and spiritual reality that influences, even directs the course of our lives.\"Conventional medicine responds to cancer patients with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and other treatment protocols to essentially get rid of the cancer. Physical signs, symptoms, and responses are carefully monitored -- while other areas of patients\\' lives receive little attention. A whole component of true medical care is missing -- as doctors may feel unprepared to address emotional issues, and time restraints allow for limited interaction between doctor and patient.Geffen believes the ultimate purpose of medicine is to help all beings \"experience unbounded love, joy, and inner peace, and to know this is the essence of who we truly are.\" This purpose, he believes, deserves as much attention as the purpose of treating symptoms and curing disease.And so Geffen created a program based on his Seven Levels of Healing -- a program that includes both the relative and ultimate purposes of medicine, both the doing and the being. Level One: Education and Information -- provides basic information about cancer and treatment options and encourages patients to actively participate in and obtain benefit from their care.Level Two: Connection with Others -- explores the importance of reaching out to others for comfort and support on the journey through cancer.Level Three: The Body as Garden -- invites patients and family members to see the human body as growing and evolving, as a complex garden rather than a machine. This level touches on good nutrition, exercise, massage, acupuncture, and a variety of complementary and alternative approaches to healing.Level Four: Emotional Healing -- enters the realm of the human heart, shedding light on fear, pain, anger, self-love, and forgiveness.Level Five: The Nature of Mind -- examines how life with cancer is influenced by our thoughts, beliefs, and the meanings we give events.Level Six: Life Assessment -- delves into aspirations, goals, and purposes of our lives.Level Seven: The Nature of Spirit -- embraces the spiritual aspects of the healing process.As a physician, Geffen aims to bring his vision of medicine and healing to cancer patients everywhere. And he uses his book as an instrument of communication -- so readers can participate in his vision, so they can learn to settle for nothing less than medical care that centers on the whole person. And not just the parts.To read previous posts on the same topic, visit:The Journey Through Cancer: IntroductionSunday Seven: Seven Levels of Healing on Cancer JourneyStay tuned for:The Journey Through Cancer: Beverly Is Every One Of Us Comments: ',\n",
       " \"Cancer cells sometimes secrete specialized proteins into the bloodstream that serve as indicators of tumor growth. These tumor markers are often distinctly associated with a particular type of cancer. Like prostate cancer.The most well-known tumor marker today is the PSA -- the prostate-specific antigen. PSA is a highly specific protein that is secreted only by cells of the prostate gland. It is one of the most widely used -- and the only widely accepted -- screening test for cancer.There's also the tumor marker CA-125, used in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer and in the monitoring of response to treatment for the same disease. There's CEA for colon cancer, CA-19-9 for pancreatic cancer, AFP for liver and testicular cancer, beta-HCG for testicular cancer, and CA 15-3 for breast cancer. And research is under way on newer, more useful tumor markers. This is a good thing -- because some tumor markers are not specific enough or sensitive enough to accurately predict tumor growth.This is why my oncologist does not recommend I enter the world of tumor markers, despite my status as a breast cancer survivor. He suggests I rely simply on how I feel for monitoring my chances for cancer recurrence. If I experience any worrisome symptoms, he will be the first to wage an all-out assessment of my health. But without symptoms, tumor markers are not likely to help me at all. A peek at my breast cancer tumor markers would likely be hazy, inconclusive, and not all that helpful. Examination of tumor markers can lead to false positives. It can lead to expensive and often unnecessary follow-up testing. It can lead to worry and panic and even alarm if the numbers are not in the hoped-for range.Although an abnormal tumor marker level may suggest cancer, this alone is typically not enough to diagnose the disease. Measurements of tumor markers are usually combined with other tests, such as a biopsy, to confirm cancer. So what would I do with an abnormal number and nothing suspicious to biopsy? I would worry. I would panic. Perhaps unnecessarily.My doctor suggests I refrain from a wild cancer chase. And I am happy with his suggestion. Between my own awareness, follow-up oncology appointments, mammograms, annual OB/GYN check-ups, and more, I am confident any health issues that come my way will be detected early -- and can be resolved in good time. I have no need for confusing tumor marker details. Unless they are conclusively recommended, I will survive without them. More important, I will survive without worry. Comments: 1. Well sounds to me like these tumor markers can do their thing. Maybe it needs a little brushing up. I think that's how it always starts. We discover something, then we discover it's not perfect. Then later we come up with the same thing, but new and improved. I think they will serve theirpurpose very soon. Let's not close our doors to tumor markers. They could at least give us a heads up ...it's up to you to not panic. \",\n",
       " \"Cervical cancer was once the most common cancer in women. But between 1955 and 1992, the number of cervical cancer deaths dropped by 74 percent -- thanks to increased use of the Pap test, a screening tool that can find changes in the cervix before cancer develops and can also detect cancer in its most curable stage. The Pap test is still widely used. And the cervical cancer death rate continues to drop four percent every year.In 2006, about 9,700 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in the United States. About 3,700 women will die from the disease. Non-invasive cervical cancer is believed to be four times more common than the invasive form of the disease. Nearly all of these cases can be cured.Cervical cancer typically occurs in women between the ages of 35 and 55 and rarely in women under the age of 20. It affects mostly Hispanic women, and African-American women develop the disease 50 percent more often than non-Hispanic white women. Women most as risk for cervical cancer are smokers, those with HIV or chlamydia infections, those with diets low in fruit and vegetable consumption, those who between 1940 and 1971 took the hormonal drug DES, and those who have taken oral contraceptives for extended periods of time. Women who have had multiple pregnancies, have a family history of the disease, and have a low socio-economic status are also at risk. Those most at risk, however, are women with human papilloma virus.Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the most common risk factor for cervical cancer, and some experts believe a woman must have HPV to contract cervical cancer. There are 100 different types of HPV, 13 of which are likely to cause cervical cancer through sexual contact. There are usually no symptoms of HPV, but possible signs of cervical cancer can include vaginal bleeding, unusual discharge, pelvic pain, and pain during sexual intercourse.There are two ways to stop cervical cancer. First, women can protect themselves against HPV. Protection comes in the form of delaying sexual activity, limiting the amount of sexual partners and their partners, using condoms (thought to be 70 percent effective) and receiving the cervical cancer vaccine, recommended for use in females ages 11-26. The vaccine is most effective for women who have never been sexually active. Second, women can receive regular Pap tests in order to catch pre-cancers. Pap tests are recommended for women three years after their first sexual encounter and before the age of 21 -- and then every year after that.An abnormal Pap test typically prompts a colposcopy -- a technique that uses a scope to examine the cervix. Diagnosis usually stems from a combination of other scoping methods, pelvic exams, imaging tests, and biopsies used to confirm the presence of cancer and to stage the disease. Stages range from 0-4.For non-invasive cervical cancer, surgery -- ranging from removal of the cancerous tissue to hysterectomy -- may be the only treatment necessary. For invasive forms of the cancer, surgery is often followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Women interested in preserving their fertility should discuss options with their physicians.The state of cervical cancer has come a long way over the years. And this year, two critical developments emerged. In June 2006, the FDA approved the first drug for late-stage cervical cancer. The drug, Hycamtin, is recommended for use in combination with chemotherapy. Also is June, the cervical cancer vaccine, Gardasil, was released. Both developments are monumental -- and both will undoubtedly help decrease the already-dropping cervical cancer death rate.For more information about cervical cancer, visit the following sites:American Cancer SocietyMayo ClinicMedline PlusNational Women's Health Information Center Comments: 1. I learned some new things here. I have been told many times by different sources that taking oral contraceptives reduces the risk of cancer. Also, I heard some story before about a nun who died of cancer.And they say the reason was because she never had sexual intercourse. I never really believed that but there some kind of bogus explanation that for some reason sounded legitimate. Anyway, at least I know I should be eating more vegetables and fruits. \",\n",

       " 'I\\'m headed for a Saturday morning workout with my fitness trainer. For one hour, I will physically challenge my body and emotionally charge my spirits. I will sweat and pant and if I am required to do the inner thigh exercise, I will scream. I will also whine -- it\\'s in my nature -- and I will push, pull, bounce, balance, lift, squat, lunge, and run until it\\'s quitting time. I will fall short on some of my exercise expectations. And I will surprise myself and exceed others. In the end, I will feel accomplished, strong, motivated, and ready to tackle the day.I\\'m making a comeback. I have come back from the depths of cancer and all of its accompanying treatment, and I have invited this powerhouse of a girl to transform me. She has accepted the challenge -- and she has helped me evolve from a weak, shaky, dizzy cancer patient to a semi-strong, 5K-running breast cancer survivor with biceps that are almost visible at a close distance.This spunky fitness girl -- also an accomplished kick boxer, wife, and mom of two little ones -- has accepted another one of my challenges. I asked her to share some of her health and fitness expertise so that we all may reap the benefits. And so she kindly extracted some important tidbits from her vast library of knowledge and concisely crafted the responses that follow.Take it from Fitz Koehler -- exercise and healthy eating habits are key for survival. For all of us. Cancer survivors included.Why is fitness important for everyone? 100% of the population needs to exercise in some way. For the most part, if you\\'re not working to get stronger, you\\'re going to get weaker. Whether it\\'s tummy time as an infant, gym class as a kid, weight training as an adult, or short walks as a senior, in order to live well and live long, we must eat well and exercise. Plus, a fit lifestyle prevents so many horrible ailments and diseases -- heart disease, some cancers, diabetes, GERD. Who wants any of that?Do you recommend weight training? Aerobic training? Both? Why?The three areas of fitness people must engage in are strength, cardiovascular, and flexibility training. Without considering personal appearance, we need to be able to climb stairs, carry groceries, and put on our socks. I can\\'t tell you how many people tell me they\\'ve thrown their backs out putting on socks. Having strength, stamina, and flexibility are essential to total fitness. How much exercise is required for achieving and maintaining general fitness? I recommend engaging in deliberate exercise most days of the week. Gardening is NOT deliberate exercise; swimming is. Train to become better. Train four to seven days of the week, and challenge yourself. No coasting! You should huff and puff during cardio, grunt while you\\'re strength training, and wince just a little while you stretch. I\\'m not suggesting you try a 10K on day one, but each workout should be meaningful. Certainly ease into things, but always aim to improve. Choose activities you\\'ll enjoy and are accessible if possible. It doesn\\'t matter what you do as long as you huff and puff, grunt and wince. Just a little. If you get an \"ouch\" pain, stop! If you get an \"ugh this is tough pain,\" go!Why is fitness important for cancer survivors? Since most survivors have been through a ridiculous amount of debilitating treatment, surgeries, and procedures, their bodies are significantly weakened. If a survivor doesn\\'t want to become weaker, he or she must train to become stronger. Creating a sturdy structure/body is imperative for two reasons. It will allow each person to regain his or her life back, to truly feel like the normal person he or she once was. Physically strong survivors will also have the benefit of being more resilient should the cancer come back. For those whose bodies have been weakened by surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and other treatment, how do you recommend easing into a fitness routine? First of all, follow your doctor\\'s orders. These people are your first line of offense with cancer. But I suggest keeping it simple and doing what you can. Even if walking to the mailbox is all you can do, do it. Start by getting back to normal life activities like grocery shopping and doing laundry -- these things take legitimate effort. Ease into deliberate exercise slowly. Walking is a simple start. Post-surgical patients need to work on regaining flexibility. I recommend The Breast Cancer Survivor\\'s Fitness Plan (Harvard Medical School Guides) by Josie Gardiner and Joy Prouty, my colleagues in the fitness industry. Many cancer survivors experience heightened fatigue, sometimes years after treatment ends. What do you suggest these tired souls -- like me -- do to incorporate exercise into their lives? Make it a priority. Like everyone else in the world, you need to schedule an appointment in your book in INK, not pencil, to make fitness happen. Use restraint at the grocery store and only bring home items that will fuel your body. The first few workouts may leave you more exhausted, but soon they\\'ll leave you invigorated and ready for more. I promise. How does diet affect health?The old saying you are what you eat is kind of true. Choose quality foods, and your body will respond. Choose low quality foods, and your body will respond too. Even if you could stay trim by exercising hard core on a daily basis, eating grease and sugar all the time will leave your body more susceptible to sickness and disease. Eating well is not only for achieving weight loss. Making great food choices is a huge component to gaining energy, mental clarity, and a complete vital body. Most people don\\'t respond to sermons on the matter, so I\\'ll avoid that. Let\\'s just change the way we look at food. The purpose of food is for fuel, not fun. Sure it can be a part of your fun, and it can also be delicious -- but a giant bowl of something fried shouldn\\'t make or break your party. Our bodies are designed to do best with a certain amount of vitamins and nutrients consumed each day. Look for these -- lean protein and dairy, fruits and veggies, whole grains, and a small amount of healthy fats should consume your plates. Make 90 percent of your meals high quality, and then enjoy a slice of cake on your birthday. A small amount of lesser quality foods are fine, as long as you put the healthy choices in the majority. You can even maintain this quality on the go at fast food restaurants. Wendy\\'s, for example, makes a tasty grilled chicken sandwich with some yogurt on the side. Good choices are everywhere now. Look for them.I spoke with a group of firefighters awhile back, and one of the habits they all had in common was the habit of driving around with a 32-ounce cola in their trucks, which they constantly refilled. Their jaws fell to the floor in sync when I told them how many calories were in that giant drink. 400! More calories than they would get in three slices of Dominoes pizza. I don\\'t believe in diets. It is simple choices like these that get people on the right track. I suggested they switch to diet soda, water, or unsweetened tea. More than 15 of those particular heroes grabbed me within three months to tell me they\\'d lost between 10 and 15 pounds only by switching to diet soda. How easy is that?Other simple choices follow. Avoid foods cooked or coated in oil or butter. A tablespoon of butter is loaded with more than 100 calories of pure fat. You certainly don\\'t need that. It\\'s simple -- all you need to avoid are the foods labeled fried or sautÃ©ed. Choose foods that are baked, broiled, boiled, steamed, toasted, roasted, grilled, barbecued, microwaved, or Lean Mean Grillin\\' machined. Just avoid dipping or smearing your food in pure fat. It could cut hundreds of unwanted calories out of each day, while preventing your arteries from clogging up. Would you ever consider putting mustard in the gas tank? It doesn\\'t belong there. Mustard shouldn\\'t go in your vehicle, and oil shouldn\\'t go in your body. Give us three diet tipsChoose 90 percent quality foodsDitch caloric beveragesAvoid cooking or coating your food in greaseGive us three exercise tipsMake it a priorityStart slowTrain for improvementPlease share anything else you think everyone should know about fitness and dietIt\\'s true that fitness can be tough -- especially for cancer survivors. It is also the one thing in the world that can provide so many benefits. It\\'s the only ONE THING that will help you avoid numerous ailments and diseases and will provide a strong resilient physique, improve mental clarity, boost energy, and positively affect the skin. Being fit relieves stress, anxiety and depression, and improves work output and relationships. Hopefully everyone who has survived cancer has figured out how precious their lives are and that the body they\\'re living in needs to be at it\\'s best.

       " \"Farrah Fawcett has been battling anal cancer for six weeks now and is two-thirds of the way through an intensive six-week regimen of chemotherapy and radiation.Fawcett, 59, has been enduring radiation therapy five days per week since October 13 and is taking the side effects -- fatigue, nausea, sleeplessness, and pain -- in stride. Fortunately, she has a strong support network that includes Ryan O'Neal, her son Redmond, her father James, and most recently -- Charlie's Angels.On November 1, Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson joined Fawcett at her Beverly Hills condominium and did what they say they've been doing ever since finding fame and friendship on Charlie's Angels 30 years ago. They talked and laughed and gossiped and ate. Just like old times.Doctors say Fawcett is responding well to treatment as she charges forward. With a little help from her friends -- and angels. Comments: 1. Keep fighting Farrah... I am a breast cancer survivor. Friends and family are your strength, reach out to them, let them help you and you will endure this much better. My prayers are with you2. Does anyone know if Farrah had HPV before the diagnosis of anal cancer?3. I started teaching first grade when I was twenty two years old. It was 1976-77 and every little boy had a Farrah picture on their notebooks and every little girl had the Farrah flip. I believe if anyone could beat this she could. She had and continues to have a smile that lights up a room....even, a classroom full of 6 year olds. 4. Just another prayer5. In September around the same time as Farrah, I was diagnosed with Anal Cloacogenic Carcinoma, which is a rare cancer. I know what Farrah is going through and my prayers go out to all those battling Cancer. I'm halfway through radiation and on Monday after Thanksgiving I will go into hospital for the last half of chemo treatment i.e.,another 5-day chemo infusion. Hang in there, Farrah---we'll get past this! 6. Farrah can fight this!! Not only is she beautiful but she's strong and determined. Godspeed Angel.7. I am battling lymphoma and wish to share information that might be of interest to Farrah. I certainly am praying for her and know that G-d is the divine healer. The information that I would like to share is of an alternative nature. I believe that we must use both approaches if cancer is to be eliminated from our lives totally. If she would like to have this information, this blog has my name and email address. If not, I understand, and wish her all the best.8. I think Farrah FAWCETT IS SUCH A BRAVE AND COURAGEOUS PERSON. TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THIS AND STILL COME OUT SMILING AND RESILIENT IS HOPE TO ALL WHO ARE BATTLING THIS TERRIBLE DISEASE.IT HAPPENED IN MY FAMILY AND IT IS DEVASTATING FOR THE PERSON BATTLING IT. PRAYERS WORK AND WE THANK GOD FOR GIVING US FARRAH, A BEAUTY AND A GREAT GREAT ACTRESS. OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH HER ALWAYS9. Farrah, I hope you read this blog. I too am a cancer survivor.I have the same critter. Waiting to find out the outcome is really the worst part. After finding out what level you are, I know you will be able to deal with it. Funny how life becomes so precious now. I had the surgery resection. Well wishes are comforting but you really have to talk to the ones that have gone through it. They will tell you what to expect after the surgery. This way there are no surprises. Only those that have gone through it will tell you how to deal with the new changes.10. Dear Farrah,I am a young 61 year old female and I have followed you throughout your career and always loved and idolized you. You appear to be so sweet and beautiful inside and out. I am so saddened to hear what you are going through and I am so glad Ryan is there for you. I hope and pray you will get through this and be a stronger and healthier person. I can't even imagine how painful this is for you and your family. You are in my thoughts and prayers. I pray to God you will be strong enough to get through this. My eyes are welling up as I'm writing this. Please stay strong and positive because if anyone can fight this you can.A long time loving fanPearl Menashexxxxxxxxxxxxooooooooooo11.

       " \"On Friday, I had my annual OB/GYN appointment. It's the appointment known by all women for (1) its blood pressure check and humbling weigh-in, (2) the pee-in-a-cup ritual, (3) the get naked and change-into-a-paper-dress routine, (4) the finger-stick-iron-check, (5) the clinical breast exam, (6) the manual internal pelvic exam, and (7) the ever popular feet-in-stirrups Pap test. It's all so uncomfortable, so not fun. Yet it's all so necessary.It was a visit with my OB/GYN that resulted in my breast cancer diagnosis two years ago this month. It was the clinical breast exam that confirmed the hard little lump I had found in the shower the previous day. It's what prompted my emergency mammogram a day later. It's what sent me on the wildest ride of my life. It's what keeps me going back for repeat yearly visits -- because I know if something goes wrong with my female parts, this doctor is likely the one who will make the discovery. He is likely the one who will save me from a late diagnosis of something terrible, the doctor who will set the wheels in motion for whatever comes after something terrible is detected.I know already that (1) my blood pressure and weight are normal, (2) my urine is normal, (3) the paper dress is so not flattering, (4) my iron is normal, (5) my breasts are normal, and (6) my ovaries and uterus feel normal. I am only waiting on (7) the results of my Pap test that will reveal any abnormalities in the tissue of my cervix. This is the one test that can save me from cervical cancer or detect the disease in a stage that is completely curable. It's one of the best cancer screening tests around -- and I plan to receive it every year, year after year -- even if I have not one ounce of modesty left when it's said and done.It's not so bad really. I'm accustomed to the rituals of the annual exam. I know the drill, know I will survive it all, know it's all critical for maintaining my health. So it's good really. Good -- compared to what could happen if something went undiscovered. Comments: 1. I know what you mean. I dread my physical each year, but not the procedure itself. I'm afraid of the outcome, which, thankfully has been ok so far. It's always a relief to get the results, one way or the other so you can put the worry behind you for a bit.\",\n",
       " 'I went to a yoga class once -- it was when I was bald from chemotherapy because I remember wearing my wig and hat and hoping desperately that nothing would topple off my head while I stretched and balanced and folded my body into various positions. My bald head did stay covered and I was able to depart from the class with my dignity intact -- but for some reason, I never went back for another yoga class. Perhaps it was the difficulty I had relaxing while trying to manage the security blanket that masked my bare head. If I ever have to do it again, I think I will leave my hair and hat at home so I can give my undivided attention to the yoga experience -- which is becoming more and more recognized for its healing power.New findings from a pilot study reveal that women going through treatment for breast cancer feel better, sleep better, and have less fatigue when they practice yoga. Side effects of treatment also seem to fade as a result of this ancient discipline. Lorenzo Cohen, a psychologist, led researchers at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and studied 61 women undergoing treatment for breast cancer. Thirty women were placed in a test group and took yoga twice per week for six weeks. The others did not take yoga. Once the study was complete, the participants completed questionnaires grading their physical abilities -- ability to lift groceries, walk a mile, and complete other physical tasks -- and also their feelings about fatigue, sense of well-being, and quality of life. The yoga group consistently scored higher on almost all physical components. No difference was found between the groups in the areas of depression or anxiety.There is no doubt that exercise contributes to a healthy lifestyle in general. And it seems yoga is no different. Focused on meditation, imagery, controlled breathing, stretching, and physical movements, yoga is sure to benefit breast cancer patients. And I think I need to give it another try. Comments: ',\n",
       " \"Tonight at 8:00 PM on ABC's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, television viewers get to witness the week-long renovation of a 135-year-old farmhouse belonging to 26-year-old Shawna Farina and her three children. It's not just the powerful makeover of this drafty Indiana house that makes for a touching story. It's the fact that Farina has been surviving breast cancer for the past 18 months, raising three children, working, raising money, and organizing her local American Cancer Society Relay For Life walks -- while living in an old, drafty farmhouse -- that makes this story truly inspirational.Inspired by her mother, who was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was a child, Farina became involved with Relay For Life -- a yearly, overnight event held in more than 4,700 communities to celebrate cancer survivorship. And now, in tandem with Farina's extreme makeover, volunteers from 18 different Relay for Life events across southern Indiana have been honoring Farina through Extreme Relay For Life events consisting of five back-to-back 24-hour relays. More than 5,000 people and the cast of crew of the Extreme Makeover: Home Edition participated while construction took place on Farina's house.It all unfolds this evening -- the story of one courageous young woman raising awareness about breast cancer in the midst of her own battle. And the story of one dedicated bunch of supporters who are building her spirit -- and rebuilding her home. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"I'm sending off my wig to a new friend tomorrow. It's all wrapped and boxed and packaged and ready to travel from Gainesville, Florida to the east coast of the sunshine state where it will land in the hands of a young women newly diagnosed with breast cancer.This new friend found me here -- on The Cancer Blog -- and we have been corresponding back and forth via e-mail about all sorts of cancer topics -- like surgery and pathology and chemotherapy and most recently, wigs. She asked me just the other day what type of wig I wore after I lost my hair to chemotherapy. I told her I didn't like full wigs, that they felt too unnatural, that I feared my little boys would rip them off my head in the middle of the grocery store. I told her I opted for underhair -- a hairfall of sorts made of plain, white, soft cotton on the top with hair hanging only from the sides and back. It is worn with hats, to cover the cotton part, and it feels quite secure -- although it did sail off my head at the beach one day, compliments of a strong breeze.I told my new friend that I was completely happy with my choice. I told her the underhair is made of human hair and that customers get to choose the color, texture, length, and size. The wig can be washed, dried, curled, styled, and cut. It looks so real that some people didn't even know chemotherapy took my hair. It was the perfect disguise for me.I led my new friend in the direction of this wig -- http://www.hiphat.com/ -- where she could order her very own handmade underhair. I told her to ask her doctor for a prescription for a cranial prothesis and to see if her insurance company would reimburse her some of the cost of this fairly expensive wig option. And then I realized it would be silly for her to do all this work and spend so much money when my wig is tucked away in my closet, sitting pretty on a nice styrofoam head, doing nothing more than collecting dust. I don't need my wig anymore. But my new friend does. So tomorrow, it begins traveling her way. And she can keep it for as long as she needs it, for as long as I don't need it. Which I hope is forever. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'On Saturday, my three-year-old threw a tantrum like never before. His daddy was departing for a football game, and he was not happy. He wanted him to stay home. He wanted to go with him. He just wanted him. Danny clung to my husband with every ounce of energy he could muster, and his full-force fit came just as I peeled his strong little fingers off my husband\\'s hand, allowing him to escape through the garage door. Danny tried to escape too so I locked and chained the door. He responded by hitting, banging, and beating the door and screaming with all his might. No amount of reasoning could penetrate this all-out display of emotion, so I carried Danny like a sack of kicking potatoes into his room where I plopped him into his bed. I told him he could come out of his room when he was ready to be nice, when he could say something other than, \"Mommy, you are not my best friend anymore.\" It didn\\'t take long for Danny to calm down. But he didn\\'t come out of the room. He fell asleep. And then my house was quiet.Enter my five-year-old who decided he wanted to watch TV while his brother napped. TV watching would have guaranteed me some down time, but I don\\'t really prefer this mindless activity. Just as I was trying to think of something productive Joey and I could do together -- coloring, painting, reading -- Joey announced, \"Let\\'s put up our Christmas tree!\" Now? In early November? Almost six weeks before we will actually celebrate this festive occasion? This request was not really consistent with my holiday planning schedule and my initial thought was to squash the idea -- because it didn\\'t fit into my grand plan of putting up the tree just a few weeks before Christmas.Planning is one of my strengths. And one of my weaknesses. Sometimes it\\'s good. Sometimes it\\'s too stifling, too rigid. So in the spirit of the my new after-cancer-worldview, characterized by the guiding principle of tomorrow is never a guarantee, I considered Joey\\'s enthusiasm for holiday decorating and realized his plan would just give us more time to really enjoy the season that always makes me happy. So I told Joey, \"Yes, we can put up our Christmas tree.\" After a trip to the attic where I wrestled with all sorts of junk and managed to gather all the necessary Christmas parts, Joey and I spent hours perfecting our tree. And when Danny woke up, he joined us and happily placed ornament after ornament on the same exact tree branch. And when we were done, we admired our sparkling tree in all its glory. On a warm, sunny day in Florida. On November 11.Tis the season. Comments: 1. Tis always the season to do something that makes you happy and allows you to spend quality time with your kids.

       " \"Beverly called Dr. Jeremy Geffen in a state of panic. She had just been diagnosed with breast cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes, just had her breasts removed, and was terrified of her recent diagnosis -- high grade infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Beverly, age 44, was told by her doctor that she would need chemotherapy and radiation. She had heard horrible stories about chemotherapy. And having never been sick a day in her life, she was scared. So when a friend told her about a caring doctor she heard speak at a conference, Beverly knew she had to locate him. She tracked down his phone number, picked up the phone, dialed, got Dr. Geffen on the phone, and asked him to help. He did. Beverly was a complete stranger to Dr. Geffen, author of The Journey Through Cancer: Healing and Transforming the Whole Person. Yet she was like so many people he knew -- people with cancer, confronted with the greatest challenges of their lives, seeking more than just physical remedies, grasping for someone who really cares.Dr. Geffen received calls like Beverly's every day. And the number of calls seemed to increase with time. It's no wonder really. Cancer is a growing presence -- and more and more people like Beverly are confronting the disease. More and more people like Beverly are seeking more than just science to cure their ailments. And in an effort to harness a little compassion in their lives, patients are reaching for alternative methods of healing -- for their minds and hearts and spirits. Yet few disclose to their doctors their secret missions for fear they will be dismissed.Beverly knew of Dr. Geffen's belief in holistic healing, his desire to treat the whole person and not just the organs and tissues and cells. So when she asked for his guidance on what treatment protocol to follow -- conventional, alternative, or complementary -- she was a bit surprised at his response.Dr. Geffen told Beverly that conventional medicine was her best line of defense. Science tells us these methods work -- and abandoning them could be tragic. Dr. Geffen told Beverly that chemotherapy and radiation, when used skillfully and sensibly, can be truly beneficial. But he also suggested she pursue complementary therapies related to diet, nutrition, exercise, and stress relief. Dr. Geffen believes in balance. And he teaches through his Seven Levels of Healing how we all can achieve balance when considering how to scientifically and emotionally heal our bodies. Dr. Geffen will detail throughout the chapters of his book how Beverly represents all the strengths and vulnerabilities of the contemporary cancer patient, how Beverly is every one of us.To read previous posts on the same topic, visit:The Journey Through Cancer: What Is The Purpose Of MedicineThe Journey Through Cancer: IntroductionSunday Seven: Seven Levels of Healing on Cancer JourneyStay tuned for:The Journey Through Cancer: State-Of-The-Art Medical Care Comments: \",\n",
       " \"I've never had a problem with crying. My tears of joy and sorrow have always flowed easily, and I have never regretted shedding any one of them. I once told a college student I mentored who was hesitant to cry over a work-related scenario that I cry all the time. She later told me my confession sticks in her mind -- my ability and willingness to cry freely, without reservation. I told her I consider crying a cleansing, therapeutic process. I told her that I always feel replenished after a good cry. And I still believe this, years and years after my encounter with this student.I cried just a few days ago while talking to my doctor and then my mom about how cancer may prevent me from having another child, if not physically, then emotionally. I just don't know if I could peacefully experience a pregnancy with the fear of cancer recurrence. And this makes me cry. Because I want another child. But I don't think I will have one. I cried at my oncologist appointment the other day while talking about the death of a friend. I cry while reading certain books and while watching sad movies and television shows. Two nights ago, I cried while watching Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, about a breast cancer survivor. I cry when recalling the births of my babies and while marveling at my little growing boys. And I know I will cry when I read a journal a friend just shared with me, written by his uncle who lost a daughter to brain cancer.Tears cleanse my soul. And sometimes, they complicate matters. They make me wonder how well I am, two years after my cancer diagnosis. I interpret my tears now more than ever, in an effort to determine how well I am coping with life in survival mode. I wonder if the tears that frequently well up in my eyes are normal or if they are indicative of the depression that prompted my oncologist to prescribe an anti-depressant. I consider that perhaps I should be better able to handle some topics, some situations, some tough experiences without becoming weepy. And I also realize that perhaps my tears are completely normal, that I could be ultra sensitive to my every emotion, that as long as I feel happy and function easily, I am just fine.I plan to iron all this out at my next and final counseling session that I need to schedule. This closing session will allow me to wrap up two year's worth of cancer issues, to close one chapter of my life and begin another. I just need to make the appointment. Which I have yet to do. Because contemplating the end of something so healing seems so daunting. And for better or for worse, this makes me cry. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"Flowers can lift spirits, brighten days, and heal hurting souls. They can actually make us healthier too. And while there is not a lot of science backing this fact just yet, it's long been understood that flowers really do help us Get Well Soon.In ancient Egypt, physicians ordered walks in gardens for patients with psychological problems. Currently, horticultural therapy is a well-established method of rehabilitation for patients with physical and mental difficulties. Medical institutions all over have created flowering spaces intended as therapeutic gardens. One study determined that 100 percent of women presented with a flower bouquet reacted with a genuine smile that involves the eyes and the mouth and indicates changes in the brain. There was no such common happiness reaction among women presented with other gifts. Further studies found that men also reacted positively to flowers. A study of cardiac patients found flower therapy improved mood and lowered heart rates, possibly reducing stress that contributes to heart disease. It seems some patients seem to forget about their pain when strolling through gardens. They forget about their pain medication too. One flower expert's research brightened her own world at a time when chemotherapy and surgery for breast cancer had her feeling pretty low. Studying flowers gave her a whole new, brighter look at the world.Flower therapy includes almost any contact with plants. Color, texture, and scent all play a part in the relaxation and healing that results from a little flower time. Why it works is a mystery -- it could be that we associate flowers with pleasure, that flowers fulfill emotional needs, that they are the pets of the horticultural world. We breed them for traits that please us and then capitalize on how they lighten the load and enhance our moods.The bottom line is this -- we just don't know exactly why or exactly how flowers do what they do. We just know intuitively that they work, that they spread hope and renewal and peace like nothing else.For more information on the healing power of flowers, pick up a copy of the November 2006 issue of The Oprah Magazine.

       " 'The lung cancer drug Gefitinib has been taken off shelves in the United States due to ineffectiveness. But it remains effective in some Taiwanese lung cancer patients, according to a study published in the journal Lung Cancer.The study, conducted by the National Health Research Institutes, involved 65 non-small-cell lung cancer patients and found that more than 50 percent of participants responded to the drug therapy -- while only 10 percent respond in Western studies.A genetic mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was found in most patients who responded to Gefitinib. The mutation is rare in Western countries but much more common in East Asian countries where the mutation increases the likelihood of developing adenocarcinoma.About 6,800 Taiwanese patients develop non-small-cell lung cancer every year. Of these, 65 percent of cases are adenocarcinoma. Of this group, 57 percent will have the genetic mutation. And roughly half will respond to Gefitinib. Comments: 1. You have to wonder how much of a population\\'s survival of (and susceptibility to) certain diseases may be the result of something as simple as a native spice they add to their food.2. While only 10% responded in Western studies, more than 50% of the Taiwanese lung cancer patients responded.

       " \"Just when cancer seems to squash all that is good in the world with its darkness and death, little rays of sunshine and little slices of hope somehow break through the devastation, leaving the world a little bit brighter.Archive of a Breast Cancer Survivor -- a newly released book by breast cancer survivor Adriene Hughes -- is an account of one woman's triumph over a disease that changed her world. It is full of sunshine and hope, despite its emphasis on a disease that every year stops 200,000 women in their tracks, spiraling them in directions so foreign they are downright frightening.Hughes uses journaling and photography to tell her story of diagnosis, surgery, reconstruction, chemotherapy, and survival. And while those affected by breast cancer will find this book truly empowering, anyone affected by any cancer will gain a healthy dose of inspiration from this poetic compilation of thoughts and images.Hughes does not seek fame and fortune by publishing her work. All proceeds from the sale of her book will go to the American Cancer Society. She will receive no financial reward from her endeavor. What she will receive is the personal satisfaction that flows from helping others. For Hughes, this is all that really matters. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'At the same Atlanta meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology where the breast cancer drug Tykerb was touted as perhaps the next wonder drug, findings were also released concerning chemotherapy and end-stage cancer. It seems that many patients in the last weeks and days of their lives are receiving chemotherapy -- when it is clear that there is no hope for survival. Perhaps patients don\\'t want to give up and so they choose to fight to the very end. I think I would be hard-pressed to throw in the towel if a doctor thought I might benefit from continued treatment. Miracles do happen.Doctors may be part of the problem, though, according to researchers. Patients don\\'t want to give up -- and neither do doctors. But cancer specialists report that overly aggressive treatment gives false hope and puts people though unnecessary suffering and costly ordeals when hospice would be a more effective route. The purpose of hospice -- to help people die with dignity and in comfort -- is ineffective, however, when it\\'s not used to its full potential. A large review of Medicare records showed in 1999 that nearly 12 percent of cancer patients died after receiving chemotherapy in the last two weeks of life. This was up from 1993 -- 10 percent -- and is probably higher today. These individuals could have been peacefully preparing for death and instead were suffering through the trials of harsh treatment.The solution -- that must be implemented by doctors -- is a willingness to accept that there is a time to stop followed by an honest conversation with the patient whose cancer has spread widely and is incurable.Another study presented at this Atlanta meeting revealed that some patients are not being offered newer treatments that might truly save their lives. New lung cancer treatments have extended survival from 20 percent at one year to 50 percent, for example. Yet only 11 percent of doctors in one Wisconsin study would refer such patients for treatment.It would be nice to know for sure that one life is about to end, regardless of treatment, and to know that another might be saved because of treatment. And maybe one day -- when treating cancer is an exact science -- this will be a reality. Comments: 1. I wish, that doctors has good education 2. I believe greater utilization of the various assay tests holds a key to solving some of the problems confronting a healthcare system that is seeking ways to best allocate available resources while accomplishing the critical task of matching individual patients with the treatments most likely to benefit them.Some of these assays sometimes provide benefit to patients who have failed traditional therapies, many of which do not work for everyone, often have unwanted side effects, and most are extremely expensive. Most oncology practices are not treating with single-agent, but with combinations of chemotherapy drugs. This further exasterbates the problem.One example is the Her2/neu. It can reasonably pick out the estimated 20% of breast cancer women at risk for recurrence, saving the other 80% of cancer patients the added expense, suffering and even death from having to take chemotherapy. Oncotype DX and EGFRx amplification/mutation have been proven in clinical decisions regarding treatment selection. Since studies show that only 25-30% of patients do respond to chemotherapy that is available to them, there should be due consideration to looking at laboratory-based mechanisms for improving the match between tumors and an ever-increasing number of partially effective and very expensive drug therapies. 3. The new EGFRx (TM) AssayThe \"targets\" that the new \"smart drugs\" go after can be located on the \"inside\" or \"outside\" of a cancer cell. The most common targets on the outside are receptors, proteins that help relay chemical messages. And many targets on the inside are enzymes, proteins that help speed up chemical reactions in the body. According to Chemical &amp; Engineering News, targeted \"small-molecule\" therapies ruled at the annual ASCO meeting of oncologists. The most exciting results shown came from studies of multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, small molecules that act on multiple receptors in the cancerous cells, like Tykerb and Sutent. The trend IS away from the monoclonals to the small molecules, a trend which EGFRx (TM) may be able to hasten. The new EGFRx (TM) assay will test drugs like Iressa, Tarceva, Sutent and possibly Nexavar, because of being small molecules. The monoclonal antibodies like Herceptin and Erbitux are \"enormous\" molecules. These very large molecules don\\'t have a convenient way of getting access to the large majority of cells. Plus, there is multicellular resistance, the drugs affecting only the cells on the outside may not kill these cells if they are in contact with cells on the inside, which are protected from the drug. The cells may pass small molecules back and forth. This may be why angiogenesis drugs may be a problem also (resistance). Some of these drugs work on anti-angiogenesis (starving tumors by shutting off their blood flow). However, tumors can acquire a blood supply by \"three\" different mechanisms: angiogenesis, co-option of existing blood vessels, and vasculogenic mimicry. \"All\" must be inhibited to consistently starve tumors of oxygen. Instead of growing new blood vessels, tumor cells can just grow along existing blood vessels, thus creating resistance to the drug. Co-option (tumor cells growing along existing blood vessels) cannot be stopped with drugs that inhibit new blood vessel formation. Vasculogenic mimicry (some types of cancers form channels that carry blood but are not actual blood vessels) cannot be stopped with drugs that inhibit new blood vessel formation. The realization that starving tumors by shutting off their blood flow requires that \"all three\" mechanisms be addressed. Drugs like Avastin (although a monoclonal antibody) can be tested with EGFRx (TM) because the target of Avastin is not the cells themselves, but rather a hormone (VEGF) secreted by the tumor cells. The Avastin complexes with free VEGF and blocks its action. The EGFRx (TM) test can discriminate between the activity of different targeted drugs and identify situations in which it is advantageous to combine the targeted drugs with other types of cancer drugs. All the more reason to \"test the tumor first.\"',\n",
       " 'I have a mammogram on Friday, I told my husband just two days before the test I will receive every six months for the rest of my life.

The test that helped find a cancerous lump in my breast two years ago and will hopefully catch any future lumps in enough time to save my life. The mammogram. It\\'s a big test that hinges on one moment of disclosure from the technician who performs the procedure. The disclosure -- everything is fine or the doctor would like to see you -- predicts whether or not life goes on normally or is derailed by uncertainty. Mammograms are a big deal.\"Are you worried?\" my husband asked after my announcement. I thought for a moment and then replied, \"No.\"For some reason, I am not worried about this mammogram. Perhaps it\\'s because I am monitored so regularly by the medical establishment and I\\'m confident anything suspicious in my breasts will be caught early and treated successfully. Perhaps the routine of it all makes mammograms not so eventful anymore. Maybe I\\'m just coping better with the seriousness of it all, and mammograms have become one more mundane appointment that requires my presence.It doesn\\'t matter really. What matters is that I am calm about my mammogram, that I am not giving it serious thought, that I am free of anxiety. What matters is that I am not worried. Comments: 1. I hope it went well today.

       " 'Every cancer patient should receive state-of-the-art medical care, says Dr. Jeremy Geffen in his book The Journey Through Cancer: Healing and Transforming the Whole Person. This medical care -- the foundation of every cancer treatment program -- should be administered by highly trained and qualified caregivers, under the meticulous supervision of an experienced oncologist.Some don\\'t believe this is the necessary foundation and consider the triad of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation both poisonous and barbaric. There is no doubt that people encounter pain, frustration, and toxicity with these therapies, according to Dr. Geffen. But he believes it\\'s almost always a serious mistake to forgo these remedies in exchange for unproven alternative therapies.There are demonstrated benefits of conventional medicine. And it is clear that with each day, treatments become safer, less toxic, and more effective than ever before. Some cancers -- like Hodgkin\\'s disease, testicular cancer, and childhood leukemia -- were once considered deadly. Now, they can be cured. The anatomy and function of the eye, breast, larynx, esophagus, anus, rectum, and prostate can now be preserved, despite surgery and treatment. Advances in pain control have delivered considerable relief to patients experiencing discomfort with treatment. And there is reason to believe future progress against cancer will be even more dramatic -- with the advent of molecular and genetic technology, immunotherapy, targeted therapies, better diagnostic technologies, and more effective control of side effects.Dr. Geffen stresses this -- conventional medicine is a must in the fight against cancer. But alternative and complementary therapies also have a place. And throughout his book, he details the Seven Levels of Healing that encompass both approaches. He begins with Level One -- Education and Information. The starting place. The place common to all of us who receive diagnoses that are troubling and confusing and require a little investigation, a little research, a little explanation.

       " 'Mammograms are offered at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in the Texas Medical Center. They are also offered on M.D. Anderson\\'s self-contained 38-foot van containing a LoRad MIV mammography unit. The van travels to various workplace sites where employees and clients can jump on board the van for a mobile mammogram. Hartford Hospital\\'s Take the Time mammogram van travels to clinics, churches, senior centers, and other Connecticut locations where women can easily access life-saving screenings. The University Breast Health Center in Augusta, Georgia is home to a mobile mammography program that reaches underserved women unable to report for on-site visits. Lexington Medical Center in South Carolina offers mobile mammograms. Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization affiliates offer their own traveling screening services. And a mobile mammogram service was offered on Kent State University\\'s campus during this October\\'s Breast Cancer Awareness Month.Mammograms on the go are no different than mammograms at fixed locations. They are high quality, safe, confidential -- and typically speedier than the traditional screening procedure. Often, a woman knows before she departs that her image is technically accurate. She can ask questions and receive information, and she can expect a prompt call from the radiologist or her physician who will discuss results. Sometimes, mobile mammograms take as little as 20 minutes to complete.Mammograms are recommended for women age 40 and older and for women with a personal or family history of breast cancer. As with all medical services, there are barriers -- such as awareness, cost, transportation, convenience -- that prevent access for some people. Mobile mammograms help drive away barriers. They allow more women more access to the best tool for identifying breast cancer in its earliest form.Roll on, mammogram vans! Comments: 1. Taking a mammogram has become a regular fixture in the lives of millions of women. It seems like a rather conservative and sensible thing to do. But is this such a benign process?The Evidence Is MixedThe evidence in favour of mammograms is largely unclear and inconclusive. And, in fact, some of the evidence against having them is startling.The basic proposal of the \\'pro\\' camp is that regular mammograms in the over-50 age group reduce the chances of women over 50 dying from breast cancer by 30%; and they reduce the chances of future mastectomies. These are the interpretations of the findings of a Swedish study reported in the Lancet in 1993.These findings have been questioned by many authorities in alternative medicine. And now, a recent study, reported in the Lancet, the British Medical Journal and the New York Times, has created more \\'official\\' concerns.Two of the members of the study group have stood apart from their colleagues and, most unusually, have voiced their concerns over the previous studies. One of the members, Dr. Peter Gotzsche, director of the Nordic Cochrane Center in Copenhagen, says: \"The quality of the trials was very surprising because it is pretty low\".In particular, it is said that these studies give no clear evidence that early identification of breast lumps leads to a reduced risk of death, or to a reduced chance of radical surgery, as claimed.On re-examining the data, it even appears as if mastectomy is 20% more likely to happen among women who have had mammograms. (It was supposed to be less likely to happen if you had regular mammograms.)The authorities in the USA and the UK say they have no plans to change their recommendations to women over 50. But then that is not surprising. They will wait for further studies before considering a U-turn on the mammogram policy of the last twenty years.So - you\\'d better look at some of the data and make your own mind up!',\n",

       " \"I heard a man interviewed on the news the other night who said the side effects of chemotherapy make him feel so poorly, so unlike he once felt. Recently, however, he discovered a remedy that makes him feel better, more like he did before chemotherapy took its toll on his well-being. His remedy -- reflexology.Reflexology does not erase the side effects of chemotherapy, but it can provide relief for patients whose lives are altered by chemotherapy-induced nausea, pain, fatigue, and anxiety.Reflexology, or zone therapy, is the application of pressure, stretch, and movement to the feet and hands in order to break up patterns of stress in corresponding parts of the body. There are many theories about how this practice actually works -- one is that applied pressure signals the nervous system to initiate changes in the brain which promotes inner balance. Still, all theories operate according to the belief that reflexology reduces stress and anxiety and lessens overall wear and tear on the body systems. And many medical professionals are incorporating this therapy into their cancer care programs.Some doctors are not so quick to embrace this complementary therapy that has no real scientific backing. They believe reflexology is nothing more than a pseudoscience, offering the same benefits as massage.The enthusiastic man I watched on the news is not concerned with popular opinion on the zone therapy he receives on his feet. It makes him feel better -- and that's all that concerns him. Comments: \",\n",

       " \"Children and teenagers -- mostly girls -- need zinc, a mineral important for maintaining healthy immune systems and healthy skin and for preventing colds and infections. Yet half of all teenage girls have zinc deficiencies. Red meat is the most effective way of channeling zinc into the body. Perhaps these young girls are eating red meat less than two times per week -- a practice research shows can contribute to zinc deficiencies.Iron is vital for good health. Menstruating women need it. The elderly need it. Pregnant women need it. And children need it too. But many lack healthy levels of iron.Red meat contains a lot of iron. And while iron also comes from vegetable sources, meat contains more iron than most foods and is best utilized by the body in this form.Red meat also contains B vitamins, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, selenium -- and protein, critical for muscle and organ health. Protein from red meat is complete, meaning it contains all the amino acids the body cannot make on its own. Protein helps the body repair and renew.There is definitely a good side to eating red meat. There is also a bad side.Red meat has been linked to incidences of bowel cancer, breast cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, high cholesterol, clogged arteries, and food poisoning.Experts say the controversy surrounding red meat comes down to the type of meat we are eating -- and how we are eating it. There are three official red meats -- pork, lamb, and beef. Pork is the leanest, lamb is the fattiest, and beef is the most nutritious. Red meat is typically high in saturated fats and bad cholesterol. But lean beef is fairly healthy -- if it's not treated with hormones and is truly free from excess fat. The more white you see, the more fat you get.So here is the trick for all meat-eaters out there -- choose lean meats, seek nutritious cuts of meat, avoid hormone-treated products, steer clear of processed meats (these include more additives and fats than simple cuts of pork, lamb, and beef), read labels carefully, make meat just one component of a balanced diet, and brace yourself for more research and study and discussion that will undoubtedly conclude that meat is good for us. And bad for us too. Comments: 1. steak is unafordable (in canada anyhow)10$/12$ dollars a slice (one meal). A bottle of zinc tablets is 3 dollars and lasts 2 months.\",\n",
       " \"One of the first recommendations I received after my cancer diagnosis was this -- write everything down. I was told to write down dates and times of appointments, results of tests, names and doses of medications, all procedures and protocols, every question that popped into my mind, and the general gist of what doctors and assistants and nurses and technicians told me. Because the stuff that comes with a cancer diagnosis is overwhelming and confusing and disorienting -- and writing it all down can help manage the chaos of it all.So I did write it all down -- which is like me anyway because I make lists for everything and feel more organized when I can see on paper everything that lies in my path.I bought a small cloth-covered journal -- it's pink with multi-colored dots on the front and back. I liked the appearance of it and it had a sweet little ribbon bookmark attached to the binding and it fit nicely in my backpack purse. It was perfect. And I started writing as soon as I got it home and found a pen. My first notes show names and phone numbers of people who became critical contacts on my breast cancer journey -- the doctor friend who connected me with all of the best medical professionals, the woman who runs the Breast Center at the hospital where I spent many days and countless hours, the chemotherapy pharmacist who came to me by way of a neighbor and who has looked out for me and checked on me and soothed me in moments of panic. These notes are followed by a listing of resources&nbsp; -- a local support group, the American Cancer Society, and various websites that I now check over and over again. And then I began to journal. My first entry reads:Tuesday, November 16, 2004: I detected a hard spot in my left breast while taking a shower. It felt like a hard, frozen pea that moved around and was difficult to locate at times. It worried me so I made an appointment with my OB/GYN for Thursday. Mom said she's had many, many cysts and that's probably what this is.The entries that follow this one detail the visit with my OB/GYN, an appointment for a mammogram and ultrasound, a referral to a surgeon, and a phone call that revealed that the hard spot in my breast was not a cyst -- it was cancer. My journaling in this book did not last for long because I transitioned to writing in a blog -- an online journal that my husband introduced to me when the word was nothing but foreign to me. I have been writing my own personal blog since December 2004 and it now contains every bit and piece and morsel of information related to my experience with breast cancer. It's full of personal encounters and medical jargon and words of wisdom and moments of pure strength and moments of sheer terror. It's my story, my journey, my life as a result of cancer.My first recommendation to someone newly diagnosed with cancer is this -- write everything down. It helps organize the madness of cancer information and it helps keep the mind occupied and it helps soothe the soul. Writing has become therapy for me. All because of one piece of advice from one person when my life was unraveling in front of my eyes. Comments: \",\n",

It makes me feel better to do something productive with my emotions, to channel my tears into something meaningful, to share my on-going journey with cancer so others may somehow benefit.My tears started to flow after I dialed Amy\\'s phone number this morning -- with the intention of speaking to her husband, almost two months after Amy died of breast cancer. No one answered my call, so voice mail picked up. And Amy\\'s voice spoke to me in words something like you have reached the Wilson\\'s. We cannot take your call. I wonder if her family has chosen to keep Amy\\'s voice as the one that greets all callers. Or have they forgotten to change the message. Or are they stuck, unsure of what to do about this permanent reminder of Amy. Regardless, it must take time to deal with such as issue.I left a message after Amy\\'s voice became quiet.

I wished him a Happy Thanksgiving and told him I\\'d try to call another day. It was the end of my message that really choked me up -- the saying goodbye to a man I\\'ve never met who recently, suddenly had to say goodbye to his 35-year-old wife, the mother of his two small children. My goodbye was so much easier than his, and I think this is why I feel sad.It made me happy to hear Amy\\'s voice today, to remember her when she was alive and well and swearing she would not let cancer take her before Christmas. And it makes me happy that no one answered my call today -- because maybe it means everyone who lives in Amy\\'s house is moving on with life, shocked as they may be that cancer took Amy weeks before Halloween.I had no idea my one phone call would churn up so many tears.

No one expected he would die. His death was a surprise.Not surprising is the collection of quality work Altman had under his belt. He is known for his work on the dark war comedy M-A-S-H, the Hollywood farce The Player, and the British murder mystery Gosford Park. Altman is also known for his method of assembling large casts and weaving in and out of storylines.

That one phone call changed everything. Forever. November 2004The next day, November 24 and the day before Thanksgiving, my phone rang at 10:00 AM and the doctor who did the biopsy said the pathology report was back already. He said that unfortunately, cancer cells were found. He said I would need a lumpectomy (surgery to remove the lump), radiation, and possibly chemotherapy. He told me to buy a book called Dr. Susan Love\\'s Breast Book.

I learned a lot from reading my new book. I learned that many women do go on to have kids after cancer but I also learned that chemotherapy in young women can cause early menopause. I learned that I have an 85 percent survival rate and also that I will get tiny little tattoos surrounding my breast to aid in the proper delivery of radiation. These permanent tattoos will also alert any future doctors that my breast has had radiation because I can never have it again in that same area. The book helped me feel positive about this journey but it also helped me face reality.I have since faced reality. And now I am surviving the reality of breast cancer. Following my diagnosis, I endured a lumpectomy, four rounds of dose-dense chemotherapy, more than six weeks of radiation, and one year of Herceptin treatment. Through it all, I learned that I am okay, that I will likely see my boys grow up, that my early menopause was only temporary, that I am physically able to have more children, that I did in fact lose my hair, that my 10 tiny tattoos are so small I can barely see them, that my survival rate is much higher than 85 percent.I knew I had breast cancer the day I detected a lump in my breast.

She did not know at the time the mass was a cancerous tumor, but she did know it was suspicious enough for further investigation. And so she sent me on my worried way, and the result of my biopsy -- cancer -- cemented our life-long relationship as doctor and patient.Every six months I see this doctor for a mammogram and ultrasound.

       " 'Journalist Lynn Sherr is grieving the husband she lost to lymphoma in 1992. It\\'s taken her many years to fully appreciate how his death affects her and while she once felt pressure from well-intentioned, clueless friends who urged her to move on, Sherr is now completely peaceful about her on-going, long-term grieving process. In fact, she fully plans on grieving -- for the man whose ashes still sit in her lingerie drawer -- for the rest of her life.Sherr writes in her new memoir, Outside the Box, that it was during an interview with a pioneering psychiatrist about the agony of loss when she made her stunning revelation about grief. It\\'s when she realized she would never fully recover from grief, that it is just fine to never fully recover.Grieving individuals do not always follow the standard stages of denial, anger, and acceptance. Yet they often feel forced into these boxes by medical professionals, family, and friends who try to move them along and consider them abnormal if they don\\'t get on with life in a set amount of time. But each person\\'s pattern of grief is as unique as each person\\'s pattern of love -- and stages and boxes just don\\'t work. Sherr\\'s breakthrough moment came at the exact moment she learned this.\"Bingo! I didn\\'t have to follow anyone\\'s pattern,\" she writes. \"I didn\\'t have to stop being sad. Not only was sadness okay, it was necessary. Nobody can tell you how to mourn. And it\\'s not self-indulgent; it\\'s not wallowing; it\\'s hanging on to something important. We should not avoid bereavement. We should embrace it, welcoming our moments of sorrow as a time to reconnect with the person we\\'ve lost.\"Sherr reconnects with her husband every chance she gets. He was her best friend, her deepest love, her soul mate, her pal. And she doesn\\'t plan to move on -- ever -- from the sadness that keeps them connected. Comments: 1.

       " \"Photographer Paula Lerner was diagnosed with breast cancer just after beginning work on Why We Walk: The Inspirational Journey Toward a Cure for Breast Cancer -- a book that captures through photographs the momentum of millions who year after year crowd America's streets and walk to conquer this disease. A peek into this book is offered in the form of an online slide show, hosted by the Washington Post. Set to inspiring music and lyrics and lasting just three minutes and 59 seconds, this media presentation tells a story about a disease that strikes every three minutes and kills every 14 minutes. Gripping photographs and sobering facts dominate this powerful piece. There are shots of women in pink wigs and pink tutus, children hosing off physically and emotionally drained walkers, women holding up photographs of lost loved ones -- one with a printed message that reads, Mom, we would walk forever to bring you back. May 14, 2004. There are smiles and cheers and tears. Every image packs an emotional punch. The facts that appear throughout the slide show really stand out. They spell out in black and white some of the most important facts about breast cancer. And here they are -- all seven of them.   40,970 women and 460 men will die from breast cancer annually.   Breast cancer is the most common cancer in African American women but   ranks second to lung cancer in cause of cancer deaths.   People over the age of 50 account for 77 percent of breast cancer cases.     Breast cancer is most commonly diagnosed among Hispanic women and is the   leading cause of cancer death among this group.   Being overweight is linked to a higher risk of breast cancer, especially   after menopause.   Risk is increased by onset of menstruation before age 12, menopause after   50, first child after 30, or no children.   Family history of breast cancer increases risk, especially if close   relatives are diagnosed before the age of 50. A first-degree relative --   mother, sister, daughter -- with breast cancer approximately doubles the risk   of breast cancer.  Comments: \",\n",

Marilyn Whitney uses watercolors to sum up her experiences. As she underwent all sorts of procedures for breast cancer, two thoughts kept crossing her mind. One thought was the tendency to flee and the other was that there must be some way to help others by describing her procedures. So after each hospital session, Marilyn would go home and craft a watercolor of what she had just seen and experienced. Then she would add a poem so the viewer would fully understand the message she was trying to convey.Prints and poems became Marilyn's method for comforting both herself and other women traveling similar roads -- and these prints and poems, all created in 1997, became pages of a book. This book -- The Tendency to Flee -- was published by the University of Florida's Center for Research on Women's Health and is full of colorful paintings and humorous words. In one watercolor, Marilyn depicts a radiation technician marking her body in preparation for the rays that would zap her. Next to the painting is a poem entitled, What's My Line.

       " 'Americans are urged to know their family medical histories -- and to share them with their doctors. Spearheaded by the U.S. surgeon general\\'s office and other public and private agencies, this urging is critical -- because knowledge of family history can lead to more frequent and earlier screenings for particular cancers, to changes in diet and exercise to combat onset of heart disease and diabetes, to more formal genetic counseling and testing if warranted.This Thanksgiving marked the third anniversary of Thanksgiving National Family History Day, a day the surgeon general\\'s office has reserved for family discussion and documentation of medical histories. \"Family history itself is the first and best genetic test,\" says Sharon Terry, president of Genetic Alliance, a non-profit group in Washington, D.C.Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital in Boston has started a work-place initiative regarding medical family history. In the past year, about half of the 13,000 employees -- from physicians to file clerks -- have completed the computerized family history forms developed by the surgeon general\\'s office.Acting surgeon general Kenneth Moritsugu says, \"knowing your family history can help you make better health choices. Much of what we do in American health care is treat chronic diseases, many of which involve choices over a lifetime.\" Comments: 1. When we think of our family medical history, we often just look to our parents. But this isn\\'t far enough. I\\'m reminded of a conversation I had recently with a man who shares the same condition as me - retinoblastoma, or eye cancer. He had two children neither of whom developed the disease. (Retinoblastoma is a hereditary condition and there is a 50% chance of passing it on, and the gene is dominant). But he and his family got a rude awakening when a grandchild was born with the condition. The gene had jumped a generation.This is a wake up call to us all. We need to look right back in our families and inform our doctors of any cancers, no matter how far back they go.As an adopted child, this creates a dilemma for me. I know that neither of my birth parents had the condition, and probably, I am the start of the chain. But what if one of my half siblings is carrying the gene? As I don\\'t have contact with any of my birth family, this is not an easy issue to resolve.But thank you for a timely reminder, Jacki. ',\n",
       " \"The state of New Jersey outpaces the nation in survival of ovarian cancer -- but it lags behind when it comes to surviving endometrial, cervical, skin, mouth, and brain cancers. New Jerseyans are still surviving cancer. But a report issued Tuesday reveals the state survival rate -- for some reason -- trails the national rate.The difference between the state and national rates is not large -- about three percentage points separate the two -- but the racial disparity appears more significant. Survival rates for white men and women are about 10 percentage points higher than those for black men and women. This is similar to the national racial gap.It's likely racial differences are due to later detection, later diagnosis, and less access to treatment and support services.New Jersey survival rates also vary greatly by type of cancer, sex, and age.

He offered me just what I was seeking. Plus something I didn't expect. My new oncologist offered me a new treatment plan -- a new course of action that better suited my specific disease.U.S. researchers reported yesterday that breast cancer patients were urged to change their treatment plan more than half the time when they received a second opinion from a multidisciplinary panel of surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, radiologists, and pathologists.Researchers at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center believe second-opinion changes are a result of different interpretations of breast imaging and pathology results, consideration of new techniques and treatments, discovery of undiagnosed second cancers, and emerging medical research.It wasn't a formal multidisciplinary team that delivered me a new, better opinion for my own cancer care. It was one man, who merged instinct and science and then consulted a well-know oncologist friend who agreed with the approach I ended up following.I am thankful for everything I gained from my second opinion -- the warmth, the compassion, the treatment plan that has served me well for two years.

The program offers immunizations for a variety of diseases at no cost to children 18 years of age and younger.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 20 million people in the United States are infected with HPV, and 6.2 million more are infected annually. The virus, that typically causes no symptoms and can go away on its own, can cause cervical cancer -- the number two cancer killer in women.Some believe giving this vaccine to young girls promotes promiscuity since HPV is sexually transmitted. Others say it should never be considered a license for sexual activity -- because it does not protect against pregnancy or other sexually transmitted diseases.The cervical cancer vaccine -- called Gardasil -- was approved by the FDA in June for use in girls ages 9 to 26.

       " \"The evidence is stacking up. And it seems almost everyone will soon agree that exercising can help prevent a return of cancer for those who have already done battle with the disease. The American Cancer Society just issued a report updating nutrition and physical activity recommendations for cancer survivors. Exercise tops the list of recommendations.For some types of cancers, exercising for just one to three hours per week can lower the risk of cancer recurrence and death, as well as death from all causes. Exercise has also been shown to improve fitness, diminish fatigue, and boost quality of life for survivors.The report also states that while a vegetarian diet may be healthful in some ways, there is no direct proof that the diet can prevent cancer recurrence. Survivors who do choose a vegetarian lifestyle should ensure they are receiving an adequate intake of nutrients.A standard multivitamin and mineral supplement equivalent to 100 percent of the Daily Value can help survivors meet their nutrient needs when it's difficult to eat a healthy diet. Some supplements -- such as those high in folic acid or antioxidants -- may be harmful during cancer treatment.According to the American Cancer Society, food safety is especially important for cancer survivors, especially during treatment that causes immunosuppression.And then there's alcohol. Alcohol can affect the risk for new primary cancers and should be used sparingly -- or not at all. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'I have had many moments in my life where anxiety and panic have filled my mind. But this is normal and necessary really as life delivers all kinds of situations that produce all sorts of emotions. I can recall vividly anxious feelings before a school exam but this is what motivated me to study and prepare and to pass the exam with flying colors. This anxiety gave me a push, a kick in the pants -- in a good, healthy way.Without a bit of panic, I may not have cared. I may have been aloof to the importance of doing well in school. But while life has presented me with a good amount of this healthy emotion, it has also tossed an abundance of unhealthy anxiety and panic my way -- the kind that has consumed my mind and twisted my insides. The kind that made peaceful living seem impossible.Living with cancer -- and the treatment that came with it -- caused me daily worry and anxiety and panic. A headache might send my mind into a tailspin of irrational thinking -- why I am having this headache? why has it lasted so long? why does it seem worse than any other headache I\\'ve ever had? maybe it\\'s not normal. maybe it\\'s cancer. maybe my cancer is spreading. how could I possibly handle another diagnosis? And on and on and on until I could barely function, barely breathe. Counseling is what saved me. It provided me with a structured way to discuss my worries and fears and I walked away with exercises to help me at home. I tried some deep breathing and guided imagery and relaxation techniques -- but what helped me most was charting my automatic thoughts.Automatic thoughts are the thoughts that pop into our heads automatically throughout the day. We are not even aware of these thoughts -- they just occur and sometimes get out of control. Becoming aware of automatic thoughts is the key. So when I feel anxiety creeping up on me, I stop and think about the situation that surrounds me. Two days ago, for example, my three-year-old son trampled all over the glass of a large framed vintage poster that I had put in the back of my van to take home from a friend\\'s house. The situation -- Danny walked on the picture and broke the glass. Simple. Then I chart my moods that result -- disappointment, anger, worry, nervousness, anxiety. My stomach felt sick. My head hurt. My chest felt crushed. And then I really think about my automatic thoughts. The thoughts that are instant and are rushing through my head. How could Danny do that? This beautiful picture is ruined. It was a free gift and now I\\'ll have to replace the glass. My friend thought she was sending the picture off to a good home and instead she watched my child destroy it.Awareness is key -- knowing exactly what is plaguing the mind. Once I was aware of my thoughts, I could begin to counter each one in a rational manner -- Danny is only three and did not know the consequences of walking on this colorful masterpiece. The picture is not ruined. It is just without glass. I can buy new glass or I can leave it as is. My friend still sent the picture to a good home. It was not destroyed. It just left her house in different form. This was an accident. It is not the end of the world. And all is fine. The picture is hanging beautifully right inside my front door -- without glass -- and I love it.While I once sat down with pen and paper to chart this process, I can now follow the steps in my head. The relief is not instant -- it takes some time to work through all my thoughts and to process them but eventually, I feel calm. My goal when I first started counseling was to live peacefully, without constant worry. This is still my goal. And I am reaching for it everyday. Comments: 1.

       " 'No one is suggesting women use the abortion pill RU-486 to keep a well-known breast cancer gene from doing its dirty work, but scientists have successfully used this pill to keep tumors at bay in mice bred with the BRCA1 gene. And while this breakthrough may not benefit the human population just yet, it does indicate there may be something on the horizon to help women who carry the gene and are destined to develop breast cancer.The BRCA1 gene spurs the sex hormone progesterone that RU-486 happens to block. If researchers could create a safer hormone blocker, it may offer an alternative for women with the bad gene. Today, there are just a few options for these women -- and all of them are anxiety-producing. Currently, women can receive more frequent cancer screenings to catch cancer in its earliest form, remove both breasts while they are still healthy, take the hormone-blocking drug Tamoxifen, and remove the ovaries to cut the risk of both breast and ovarian cancers. A better option is necessary for women faced with an almost certainty of developing cancer.The deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society calls this study elegant research. But he stresses that \"it would not be appropriate in any way, shape or form that women start taking RU-486 for this purpose.\" Long-term use of this abortion drug can cause other side effects, including immune system suppression.Cancer specialists applaud this development. Yet they caution women to not get their hopes up yet. They say this is an avenue worth pursuing on a research level. But it\\'s clearly too soon to start recommending use of an agent like RU-486 for breast cancer prevention. Comments: ',\n",
       " 'Nearly half of all cancer patients and others in their households have trouble coordinating cancer care, according to a recent public health poll.Many who participated in a recent telephone poll revealed they were confused about prescriptions, were sent for duplicate tests, and received conflicting information about their treatment plans.Experts say choreographing care is one of the most important challenges in the world of cancer. Navigating the maze of medical madness can be emotionally draining and can even hurt a patient\\'s chance of recovery. Now is the time to become advocates for our own health -- before we are left behind. So get ready to take charge -- and consider these seven thoughts on actively coordinating your own cancer care.   Today, cancer patients spend more time at home and not in hospitals like   they did generations ago. This leaves them to manage much of their care on   their own -- often a monumental and overwhelming task. Patients, or a   designated friend of family member, should document every tidbit of medical   information, including names, phone numbers, medical records, instructions,   medications, dosages, appointments, questions, responses, and more. Jot down   symptoms and worries and concerns. File away pamphlets and handouts and bills   and receipts. Don\\'t count on memory alone to provide all the details. Allow   for back-ups. They will serve you well.   Most cancer patients need a whole team of doctors -- radiologists,   pathologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons -- but each   doctor may handle only one aspect of care while no one runs the show. It\\'s the   perfect scenario for disrupted and piecemeal care, says one doctor. Consider   searching for comprehensive cancer centers where a variety of professionals   are housed under one roof and patients can often meet with all their doctors   at one time. Currently, only about 10 percent of cancer patients are seen at   this type of large center.   Many doctors are stuck in electronic gridlock because doctors in one   building may be unable to access the records of doctors in other locations due   to incompatible computer systems or paper charts. Patient advocates say all   patients should have easily accessible electronic medical records. One cancer   center hopes to start a program that would allow for storage of patient   records on small, portable USB flash drives. Patients would keep the drives   and could plug them in at home or at their doctor\\'s office.   Cancer patients often suffer from lack of information. Long-term   survivors, for example, often have trouble recalling exactly what was done to   them. And over time, doctors may relocate or pass away, leaving survivors with   little to reconstruct their journeys.   Shortly after diagnosis, patients should request from their doctors a   care plan -- an outline of how doctors plan to treat their cancers.     Patients should also receive a treatment summary at the end of   therapy. This should outline all surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation,   medications, and dosages.   A plan for ongoing care should be offered to all cancer patients   so they know how to monitor their health. This plan should include guidance on   screening tests, follow-up visits, and potential long-term side effects. \"A lot of anxiety results from not knowing what comes next\", says one patient advocate. \"People armed with good information tend to make better decisions.\" Comments: 1. Good point Jacki, about cancer patitents needing a whole team of doctors, and also the \"right\" team. My wife was seen for over eight years, only by medical oncologists at our local community hospital. We thought that was enough, until I realized in a phone call I made to them in 1998, that because of taxol, she had a brain met. \"What do you want us to do about it?\" was the answer I received. \"Excuse me, you are oncologists,\" I replied. They said, \"we are not that kind of oncologists, we are involved with giving patients chemotherapy (medical oncologists). It was a rude awakening to find out that she should have been seen during those years by a gynecologic oncologist at a leading cancer center and not just by chemotherapists at our local community hospital. Fighting one\\'s cancer is a \"team\" effort.I use to think the same way about comprehensive cancer centers as Jacki suggests. The very next phone call I made was to the leading comprehensive cancer center in Philadelphia that excised her metastatic transdiaphragmatic tumor from her chest, two years prior. They \"did not have a neurosurgeon on staff and wouldn\\'t be able to help us\" was the answer I received. A leading comprehensive cancer center not having a neurosurgeon on staff??? Fortunately, I called a teaching hospital, and by the end of the week, she was operated on by one of the neurosurgeons who writes the text books about brain surgery. I wish I knew then, what I know now.',\n",

       " 'It\\'s not surprising marathon runners face an increased risk of skin cancer due to long-term sun exposure. What\\'s surprising is that so many are not taking measures to protect themselves from the sun\\'s damaging rays.A team of Austrian researchers, all of them dermatologists, became interested in studying long-distance runners when they realized they had collectively treated eight ultra-marathon runners with malignant skin cancer over a period of 10 years. All researchers are themselves enthusiastic runners, and two of them participate in marathons. The topic was near and dear to their hearts.Research was conducted on white runners, so it is unclear if the findings -- listed below -- apply to black runners.   Only 56 percent of runners in the study reported wearing sunscreen. Most   were unaware of the increased risk to their skin -- and even the running   researchers report it is good to be reminded to wear the right gear and   regularly use sunscreen   Many runners race with a lot of skin exposed. And sometimes training   clothing covers different areas than racing clothing. Shoulders that are   covered during training may be exposed during the long hours of a marathon.   During triathlons, most wear a bathing suit for the duration of the event,   leaving most skin susceptible to burning. Runners can lower their risk by   training during morning and evening hours and wearing water-resistant   sunscreen. They can wear clothing made of new fabrics that screen harmful   ultraviolet rays.   It\\'s possible that endurance athletes may have suppressed immune systems   caused by repeated tissue damage, leaving them more vulnerable to skin cancer.   While some marathon runners take pride in a bronzed skin -- proof they are running in the elements -- researchers hope runners will consider the risk they face. In some races, volunteers offer to quickly apple sunscreen on athletes who don\\'t want to lose precious seconds as they race for the finish line. It\\'s a start. Comments: 1. This blog draws attention to important points about sun exposure during long running events and skin cancer, but there is a flip side.The flip side is that using sun blocking lotion regularly tends to decrease vitamin D production by the skin, and that is associated with increases in a number of cancers and other health conditions. For years before I was diagnosed with prostate cancer, I used sun blocking lotion regularly during the warmer months as I was on the track or out in the open for workouts of a half hour to an hour for racewalking, which, of course, takes considerably longer than running, mile for mile. I suspect that blocking the sun was one factor contributing to my developing an aggressive case of prostate cancer.I\\'m now supplementing with vitamin D3, and have recently increased the dosage to about 4,000 per day, which seems appropriate in my circumstances. I also get my vitamin D level tested regularly.Jim Waldenfels (website: <A href=\"http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147\" rel=nofollow>http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147</A>)',\n",

Many would suffer such extreme side effects from these drugs they would stop taking the medication early, decreasing even further their potential odds for survival.The fate of these patients is changing. And the proof is in print -- in today's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.It all began with the study of a highly targeted molecular therapy called STI571 -- designed to block the genetic aberration that gives rise to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a disease that affects about 6,000 Americans every year. A clinical trial followed, and a compound marketed by the drug company Novartis emerged. Today, this compound is know as Gleevec.In the clinical trial of Gleevec, 1,106 CML patients were randomly chosen to receive either Gleevec or Interferon. Early results were so encouraging that all but three percent of the participants using Interferon switched to Gleevec. Five-year survival rates were 89 percent. And 93 percent of patients saw no progression to the acute phase of the disease. Many patients witnessed their blood counts return to normal, and a large number experienced a reverse in the gene mutation that causes CML. Virtually no one reported side effects while using the drug.Despite a rare reaction that can cause heart failure, Gleevec has now been approved by the FDA for the treatment of six other rare, life-threatening disorders. And other drugs similar in nature to Gleevec are hitting the scene.

I could open the pages of this almost 600-page book and find up-to-date and accurate information. The information I found eased my mind and gave me hope -- and it also scared me and introduced to me to the sometimes-tragic effects of breast cancer.I learned from Dr. Love that statistically, my survival rate was pretty high. But I also learned that my cancer was most likely aggressive due to my age. The younger the woman, the more aggressive the tumor -- and I was 34 at the time. I learned that medical advances have come a long way and that this fourth edition book captured the wonders of medicine in a way that Dr. Love's first edition could not. But I learned also that treatment for breast cancer still is dominated by the slash, burn, and poison approach -- surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy are still standards of care. And they can be barbaric. Dr. Love taught me that I would receive permanent tattoos on my breasts and chest area to prepare me for radiation; that the chemotherapy drug Adriamycin is toxic if it touches the skin and can cause heart toxicity too; that my fertility would be in question after the conclusion of treatment; that my hair would fall out, my stomach would be sick, and my immune system would be attacked. Dr. Love introduced me to her thoughts on alternative treatment and diet and environmental factors influencing breast cancer. She taught me the lingo and the buzzwords and helped me understand the then-mysterious world of this disease I really knew nothing about.Now I know a bit more about breast cancer -- because of Dr. Love and her insightful book and because I've now been slashed, burned, and poisoned and have experienced the intricacies and complexities of breast cancer for myself. Dr. Love prepared me for this ride of my life and because of her foundation and direction, I believe my ride was a little less bumpy. And if I have a repeat trip in the future, I will be in a much better place. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'Cell phones don\\'t cause cancer, according to a major study from Denmark that tracked 420,000 Danish cell phone users -- many of them users for more than 10 years and some for more than 20 years.In the largest ever study to yield good news about the safety of cell phones, scientists matched phone records to the Danish Cancer Registry -- a listing that records every citizen who gets the disease -- and on Tuesday, the study results were revealed. Cell-phone users are no more likely than anyone else to develop cancer.But the lead researcher of this massive investigation says doubts will surely linger. There is really no biological basis for concern about radio waves, he says. But people still worry.Cell phones beam radiofrequency energy that can penetrate the outer edge of the brain, causing suspicion about the origin of various cancers. Most research has found no link between cell phones and cancer, but the phones have never been given a definite clean bill of health either.\"As the body of evidence accumulates, people can become reassured that these devices are safe,\" says one cell phone researcher.

       " \"A not-so-new tumor-cell biomarker has been newly unveiled by researchers. And it just might predict how well women will fare after they've been diagnosed with breast cancer and how to best treat each cancer.When expression of the marker -- called p27 -- is low, especially among women with hormone-receptor-positive tumors, prognosis is typically poor. P27 was first discovered more than a decade ago but has not been useful for prognostic purposes until now. Previous studies on the marker failed to deliver all patients the same treatment -- so researchers could never determine if outcomes were due to p27 or treatment. But a recent study -- published in the December 6 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute -- followed the same patients receiving the same treatment for newly diagnosed, hormone-receptor-positive, moderate-risk breast cancer.The new study found women with tumors high in p27 expression had a five-year survival rate of 91 percent. Women with a low expression had a five-year survival rate of 85 percent.No association was found between p27 expression and survival among women with hormone-receptor-negative tumors.The next step in the study of this potentially important marker is to better define how women will benefit from this information. Comments: 1. How can I pose a comment and inquiry related to breast cancer tumors and other related topics on this blog? I really need information asap.thanks, annie2. I have just finished chemotherapy (taxotere and cytoxin) and radiation for stage II breast cancer. During radiation treatment I started getting terrible joint and muscle pain. I could barely move - I felt like a 100 year old arthritic cripple! Since I finished radiation (1 month ago) the pain has subsided but is still present. All my joints ache. Neither my oncologist nor my radiologist can give me an answer. Could it be rheumatoid arthritis or could it be a delayed sde effect from the chemo? I've hear that Taxotere can cause joint and muscle pain. If anyone has an experience or info they want to share I'd really appreciate it. \",\n",
       " \"Glioblastoma is the deadliest form of brain cancer, most often striking patients in their 50s and 60s who after diagnosis typically have only 10 to 12 months to live.Glioblastoma is a shocking diagnosis -- and while the tumors don't tend to spread outside the brain, they resist surgery and return even when half the brain is removed. They also are resistant to most treatment. Clearly, insight into this deadly cancer is a must. Thankfully, a little slice of insight has just emerged.Armed with findings from experiments in mice, researchers report they've discovered a clue that might help unravel the mystery of glioblastomas. Studies show that some mice recovered from a human form of brain cancer when given bone morphogenetic proteins that appeared to interfere with the cancer growth process in stem-like cells. This leads researchers to believe the proteins could be used to stop cancer growth and prevent it from recurring.The research is not ready for prime time, says one of the researchers who maintains there is still a long way to go. Yet the findings are promising -- and they suggest stem cells may play a critical role in tumor formation.About 17,000 to 18,000 Americans develop brain cancer each year. Half of these patients will be diagnosed with glioblastoma. Comments: \",\n",

       " \"I've had my very own extreme makeover. And while it has nothing to do with cosmetic plastic surgery or an overhaul on my house, it's been an appearance-altering and life-changing event. I'll call it my Extreme Makeover: Cancer Edition.Stop OneThe first stop on my extreme makeover tour came compliments of a lumpectomy -- to remove one cancerous tumor in my breast along with four lymph nodes. I was left with two scars that travel underneath my armpit, a bit of scar tissue buried beneath the skin, and a tinge of numbness that comes and goes without warning.Stop TwoMy second stop brought me a port -- to save my veins and ease the infusion of chemotherapy -- which for more than a year allowed me to look a bit like an alien. A foreign object sewn under the skin of my collarbone popped up something like a tracking device that identified my whereabouts. Now surgically removed, my port has been discarded. A scar marks the one-time location of this wondrous apparatus.Stop ThreeThe third facet of my makeover was quite extreme -- is still quite extreme. It happened like clockwork -- 13 days after my very first chemotherapy treatment -- and while I knew it would happen, the shock of total hair loss was not minimized in any way, shape, or form by predictability. And the shock of my new dark, curly hair with a sprinkling of gray -- that replaced my blond, straight hair -- amazes me every time I look in the mirror.Stop FourFor four months, I lost my menstrual cycle to chemotherapy -- not such a bad deal except for the hot flashes that arrived for the same four-month period. When my cycles returned, they were unpredictable and much more intense than ever before. They are still problematic.Stop FiveSurgery and radiation limited the range of motion in my left arm. Physical therapy helped some, and weight training helps too. But my arm is permanently affected by the attempts to save my life.Stop SixJust when I thought my makeover journey was coming to an end, my mind told me otherwise. Bouts of fogginess, forgetfulness, and just plain odd behavior marked the beginning of what researchers now call chemo brain. The plentiful drugs that cycled through my body for almost two years are playing tricks on my brain. Stop SevenAnd to cope with it all -- my scars, my hair, my confusing cycles, my tightened arm, and my chemo brain -- I made one last stop at the pharmacy for an anti-depressant. Prescribed so that I could become accustomed to my new life after cancer, my Zoloft keeps me calm and peaceful and happy. And one day, when I have adjusted to all that has changed in my world, I will wean myself off this potion.I am not sure I would ever elect to alter my appearance -- although I am sometimes tempted by a tummy tuck to remove what two more-than-10-pound babies left with me.Mostly, I think cancer has done enough to reshape and redesign my whole self. And while I didn't wish for any of my cancer changes, I think they help me define me. They tell a story -- of challenge and hardship and victory and survival. For as long as I am alive, for as long as my extreme makeover is visible, it will be clear that I have conquered something great and powerful. And that makes me proud. Comments: \",\n",

       " 'I have tried to exercise most of my adult life -- at times because I felt obligated to participate in what I knew was good for me and at times to justify eating my favorite foods while maintaining an appropriate weight and at times because I wanted to actually have a toned, healthy body. At this exact time in my life, I exercise with all of these motivations in mind -- plus a few more. I like to sweat and know I am accomplishing a physical feat. I like the mental release I get when I push my body to perform. I like the time to myself, the loud music I hear on my MP3 player, and the results I see from a little bit of hard work. And lately -- as a result of a new weight training program -- I know I am benefiting my body more than ever before. The following are just seven of the many gifts that come from weight training. Gifts that will make me a happier, healthier cancer survivor.Noticeable physical results -- Mostly, walking and occasional jogging have been my methods of exercise. And I\\'ve seen results from this type of workout -- leaner legs, more defined calf muscles, and the knowledge that I am increasing my cardiovascular health, as confirmed by the technician who performed an ultrasound on my heart in preparation for my Herceptin treatment for breast cancer. He told me he could tell I exercised regularly because of my low resting heart rate. But until I started weight training a few months ago, I never witnessed quick results. Yet after a few weeks of resistance exercise -- lifting 20-pound weights for my arms, shoulders, back, and chest -- I could see definition and tone that clearly would not have resulted from my purely cardio workouts. Improved strength and endurance -- Lunges and squats and jumping with resistance bands have strengthened my legs. Lifting weights has strengthened my arms -- and I can now lift heavier weights than when I first started my new routine. I can do more push-ups now too -- not girl push-ups on my knees but real push-ups -- than I ever could have imagined doing when I could barely lower my own body weight and would crash to the floor on my stomach. My strength has improved. My endurance has improved. I feel more powerful.Increased energy -- Fatigue (or maybe it\\'s laziness) sometimes prevents me from happily jumping up to begin exercising. But when I push myself and exert myself and get lost in my exercise routine, my energy returns -- and not just during my workout but for some time afterwards too. Some say energy increases from strength training because it contributes to loss of fat which means we have less to lug around each day.Burning of more calories -- Weight training raises basal metabolism which causes more calorie burning over a 24-hour period of time. Calories even burn during sleep as a result of weight training.&nbsp; For every additional pound of muscle you gain, your body burns 50 extra calories every day -- 50 more calories than the few hundred that might burn from aerobic exercise. Research shows that regular resistance training can increase your Basal Metabolic Rate by 15%. So for someone who burns 2000 calories per day, that\\'s upwards of 300 extra calories burned every single day.&nbsp; Decreased onset of illness -- Weight training can reduce the risk of adult onset diabetes and the risk for developing colon cancer and can improve the functioning of the immune system and the efficiency of the heart. It decreases the risk of low-back injuries, decreases resting blood pressure, increases good cholesterol (HDL), and improves posture. The list goes on -- and so does healthy living if weight training becomes a way of life. As a young person already having experienced a life-threatening illness, this comforts me.Prevention of osteoporosis -- My recent bone density test revealed that I am not at this moment at risk for developing osteoporosis. I don\\'t want this to change. Strength training can help me maintain this status because it can significantly increase bone mineral density -- which is important because we naturally lose bone density as we age. Strength training helps protect against osteoporosis. And age should not be a deterrent. Individuals who begin training late in life -- at age 65, for example -- can restore bone loss. Improved outlook on life -- As a result of toning and shaping my body, burning calories, enjoying greater strength and energy, and working toward a disease-free future, weight training gives me an improved outlook on life. And weight training has recently been reported to significantly improve the quality of life of women recently treated for breast cancer. A May 2006 study indicates six months of twice weekly exercise was enough to improve the overall physical and emotional condition of patients. Twice weekly is my weight training goal. I will continue to walk and run -- and bike on occasion too -- but strength training will be my priority. Because health is a priority. Comments: <STRONG>Burning of more calories -- <A href=\"http://www.weightlossresources.co.uk/calories/burning_calories/burn_more_calories.htm\">Weight training</A> raises basal metabolism which causes more calorie burning over a 24-hour period of time.

       " 'I never knew how to accurately describe the personality of my oldest child until his preschool teacher told me about her son. The contrary kid, she called him, for his tendency to resist everything that crossed his path. The moment I heard this title, I adopted it and immediately applied it to Joey. It\\'s a perfect fit for this boy, who has spent almost six years embracing disagreement as a way of life.Yesterday, I picked up Joey from kindergarten and told him he and his brother would play at my sister\\'s house for the afternoon while I went to an appointment. I told him he\\'d get to play with his cousin on her new swing set and play his favorite motorcycle video game. Three-year-old Danny liked this plan, and was set to instantly jet to Aunt Tracy\\'s house. Joey, however, took his typical against-the-grain approach. \"Nope, I\\'m not going there,\" he reported, even though he always has a great time at Tracy\\'s house -- and rarely wants to leave.Joey\\'s sixth birthday is approaching, and he has been helping me brainstorm ideas for an extravagant pirate party. I asked him recently to help me address the envelopes for his invitations. My plan -- since his teacher says he needs to work on his writing -- was to have him write the first name of each invitee on each envelope. I told him about this project -- he loves projects -- and he said, \"Oh, no, I\\'m not going to do that,\" despite his love for writing and drawing and creating.A pediatrician told me when Joey was just three months old and I was concerned he was not a very content baby that a child\\'s personality is carved in stone beginning in infancy. There\\'s no changing it, he told me, just before he advised me to find a way to cope with my not-so-easy boy. He also told me to instill in this delicate boy strategies for coping with a disposition defined by resistance. This coping thing is a work in progress for our whole family. Sometimes we do well -- when we find a balance between occasionally allowing Joey decision-making control and other times calmly disregarding his protests. Sometimes -- when we can\\'t seem to find any sort of balance -- we don\\'t do so well. I watched a video of Joey last night. He was three years old and just as defiant as he is today. It makes me sad for Joey that he has spent all these years fighting the current of life. It makes me worry that his little insides will one day suffer from a lack of easiness. But I also try to see the bright side of this spirited little boy -- the side experts say may help him when he grows up and can assert himself in all sorts of scenarios. When faced with peer pressure, Joey may simply put his foot down, say \"No,\" and move on his merry way. He\\'s done this once already -- when preschool classmates laughed at his toenails that were painted orange and blue. When his daddy and I asked how this made him feel, he said, \"I don\\'t care. I like my toes.\" Good for him, his preschool teacher -- the mother of her own contrary kid -- told me. He is very sure of himself, she said.When my perspective on Joey\\'s temperament is optimistic, I realize my little guy helps me stay strong. Ever since I was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago, Joey has helped me resist the tendency to feel sorry for myself and give in to weakness. He reminds me to adopt my own contrary view on cancer -- to resist the notion that cancer will limit my life possibilities. When I doubt myself, he senses it and tells me, \"You can do it, mommy,\" and \"You are tough.\" And just the other night, following a family dancing frenzy at his Nana\\'s house, he told me, \"I love you, babe.\" I love you too, Joey. You are one heck of a contrary kid.Note: Joey did go to his Aunt Tracy\\'s house to play. He had a marvelous time. He did not help me address the envelopes. Comments: ',\n",

       " 'Those who just can\\'t quit smoking may have a teeny, tiny bit of added protection from a possible onset of lung cancer -- if they are willing to get out there and sweat.In a study of older women, researchers found that physically active smokers have a 35 percent lower risk of developing lung cancer than their sedentary counterparts.This doesn\\'t mean that women who exercise have a free pass to smoke, but the study does reveal the lowest risk of lung cancer among study participants was found in those who had moderate workouts more than four times per week, or vigorous workouts two or more times per week.It is unclear why physical activity might have a preventive effect on lung cancer. Perhaps the improved pulmonary function resulting from exercise reduces the concentration of carcinogenic particles that deposit in the lungs. Or maybe becoming more physically active increases smokers\\' awareness of the damage they have caused their lungs, motivating them to smoke less or quit.One thing is clear, however. The single most important step a smoker can take to prevent lung cancer is quitting the nasty habit -- because those who stop smoking are 10 times less likely to develop lung cancer than those who smoke.Dr. Norman Edelman, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association does not want smokers to gain a false sense of security from this study. \"We don\\'t want people to get the wrong message,\" Edelman said. \"A regular smoker has a risk of lung cancer 10 times that of a nonsmoker, and 35 percent reduction in that risk is trivial.\"Edelman also states that the study does not address the effect of exercise on other smoking-related health problems, such as emphysema and heart disease. And because the active women in the study were less likely to be overweight, it is unclear if the lower lung cancer rate is a result of their exercising or their weight.

I am an emotional wreck and my wonderful loving husband is taking the grunt of it all as well as my two beautiful kids -- my five-year-old little girl and two-year-old son. <EM>Like you said my five-year-old just knows mommy is going to the doctor a lot and has a boo-boo but my 2-year-old is clueless which is nice. I just want my husband and kids to have their mom around for all the wonderful things that have yet to come but I don\\'t want to be in this hole that I sometimes feel like I am in. Some days are great but some really, really stink. <EM>Well, sorry to vent on you but the other thing is you feel so alone in this even though I have wonderful friends and a great husband. I don\\'t always want to be the downer of the conversation. <EM>Just wanted to share and let you know that your stories and blog are very helpful. Take care and my prayers are with you and your friends and families. 1.

       " 'One common thread woven into overall cancer prevention and survival is this -- exercise.One hour of daily vigorous exercise -- or two hours of less strenuous activity -- is now linked to a lower risk of colon cancer, according to the results of a recent study. Jogging, pumping iron, swimming, and even housecleaning can do the trick, as demonstrated by research conducted with 413,000 people in 10 European countries. Of those studied, people with the highest level of exercise were 22 percent less likely to develop cancer and 35 percent less likely to develop tumors on the right side of the colon. Those of normal weight enjoyed a greater benefit, but exercise was also beneficial for the overweight and obese. Exercise did not have a protective effect against rectal cancer.This research -- helping to support the fact that about 70 percent of colon cancer cases can be prevented by changes in diet and exercise -- is significant because of the large sample size and the different levels of activity observed across the borders.Colon and rectal are among the most common cancers in developed countries. More than 940,000 cases are diagnosed each year. About 492,000 people die from the illness. Comments: ',\n",

       " \"I had a free massage the other day, compliments of a local massage workshop called Caring for Clients with Cancer. This hands-on gift came to me by way of a woman who was once a scientist and is now a massage therapist. Concerned that cancer patients are rarely encouraged to cash in on the benefits of touch therapy, this woman merged her two disciplines so she could help patients heal in a holistic manner. And so her workshop was born. And I was invited to take part.I received one completely soothing and invigorating massage. I also received one completely inspiring packet of quotes -- that I've already read over and over again -- related to recovery and healing. Each quote is so perfect in its message, and I wish I could share them all today. But time and space are limited at the moment, and I can only share a few. So here are seven of my favorite quotes, free for the taking, a gift from me to you. Take a moment to read them, share them, savor them, and quietly reflect on the power of these simple words.People who have been through illness's dark passage can occasionally give us a glimpse, not only of what it is like to become whole, but of what it is to be more fully human.--Marc Ian BaraschThe Healing PathThose who have suffered understand suffering and therefore extend their hand.--Patti SmithWhat matters is this: you can look at a scar and see hurt or you can look at a scar and see healing. Try to understand.--Sheri ReynoldsI have a duty to speak the truth as I see it and to share not just my triumphs, not just the things that felt good, but the pain, the intense, often unmitigating pain. It is important to share how I know survival is survival and not just a walk through the rain.--Audre LordeIllness is the night-side of life, a more onerous citizenship. Everyone who is born holds dual citizenship, in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick. Although we all prefer to use only the good passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a spell, to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place. --Susan Sontag, Illness as MetaphorRemember that everyone you meet is afraid of something, loves something, and has lost something.--H. Jackson Brown, Jr.Patience is a hard discipline. It is not just waiting until something happens over which we have no control; the arrival of the bus, the end of the rain, the return of a friend, the resolution of a conflict. Patience is not waiting passively until someone else does something. Patience asks us to live the moment to the fullest, to be completely present to the moment, to taste the here and now, to be where we are. When we are impatient, we try to get away from where we are. We behave as if the real thing will happen tomorrow, later, and somewhere else. Let's be patient and trust that the treasure we look for is hidden in the ground on which we stand. --Henry J.M.

       " 'There may be another explanation for the recently announced decline in breast cancer rates. And it\\'s not nearly as promising as the first explanation may be.A day after researchers announced that the significant drop in breast cancer cases is primarily due to fewer women using hormone replacement therapy (HRT), some experts suggest breast cancer rates are not dropping at all. Just as many women may have breast cancer, they say. They just aren\\'t being screened for it.\"We have been aware for several years that the number of radiologists who specialize in mammography have been decreasing, and that there are places in the United States where women have difficulty getting access to mammography,\" Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, wrote on the society\\'s blog just after the public announcement. \"If mammography use has reached a peak and is now decreasing, we may actually be diagnosing fewer cancers when they can be most effectively treated, Lichtenfeld said. \"If you don\\'t get a mammogram, you don\\'t diagnose a cancer.\"The research linking the decline in HRT to the drop in breast cancer came from the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and was discussed at a breast cancer conference in San Antonio on Thursday. The research, based on a report by the National Cancer Institute, showed a seven percent drop in new breast cancer cases between July 2002 and August 2003, corresponding with the results of a 2002 Women\\'s Health Initiative study.With media reports citing HRT as the direct cause of the drop, some worry the public is getting the wrong message -- specifically women still taking hormones or those who have taken them in the past. While women not taking hormones are breathing a sigh of relief, others are in a panic.Dr. Katherine Sherif, director of the Drexel Center for Women\\'s Health at Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia, has spoken already with 15 patients worried about this news. \"What I have told them is that three years is too short of a time to measure the effects of a drug on breast cancer,\" she said. \"Cancers take decades to develop, and conversely, withdrawing hormones could not result in a decrease in breast cancer in three years -- it\\'s actually absurdly short.\" There are also concerns women will experience anxiety about other therapies using estrogen, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). var oDiv = document.getElementById(\\'columnad\\'); var embedDiv = document.getElementById(\\'embed_links\\'); if(oDiv.offsetWidth > 160 &amp;&amp; oDiv.offsetHeight > 300) { embedDiv.style.width = \"238px\"; } else { embedDiv.style.width = \"360px\"; } The study on HRT and breast cancer may be raising more questions than answers -- which could be a good thing.

       " \"In November 2004, my husband I and decided to try to have a third child. But instead of getting pregnant, I got breast cancer. And with the aggressive treatment I would receive -- surgery, dose-dense chemotherapy, radiation, and Herceptin therapy -- becoming pregnant was not an option. Birth control became my only option -- an option that has many limits for premenopausal women surviving breast cancer.Many forms of birth control contain hormones -- the pill, the patch, the vaginal ring, injectables, implants, and one type of IUD that releases progesterone. That leaves condoms, spermicides, diaphragms, cervical caps, one type of IUD that does not release progesterone, and sterilization as the methods that do not release hormones. For me, condoms and spermicides are not dependable enough, the cervical cap and diaphragm are made from latex -- an allergy of mine -- and I do not wish to sterilize my husband or me at this time. So that leaves one option for me for preventing pregnancy -- the IUD that releases copper instead of a hormone. The ParaGard Copper T 380 A can stay in place for 10 years, has a less than 1 percent failure rate, is ready for use immediately after inserted by a doctor, and is considered the only long-lasting, reversible, hormone-free birth control method on the market. Some breast cancer tumors are fueled by the hormones estrogen and progesterone -- the same hormones that are released by some forms of birth control. While studies have not proved a definite strong link between breast cancer and the use of hormone-releasing birth control, my doctors recommend avoiding any hormonal treatment. And it brings me peace of mind to take their advice. So my only option -- the copper IUD -- is what I now use for birth control. And it has proved to be a good only option. I have had no side effects -- although some people may experience side effects -- and I've had no problems and no pregnancies. My only option works well for me. Thankfully. Comments: \",\n",

       " 'Before 2002, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was believed to prevent many conditions, and doctors routinely prescribed hormone pills. But when a 2002 study found HRT raises the risk of breast cancer, heart disease, and other problems, the use of hormones plummeted.On Thursday, researchers reported that the rate of breast cancer cases in the United States dropped more than seven percent in 2003 -- the year after the landmark study that caused a backlash against hormones. This backlash is considered the leading cause for the now-reported decline in breast cancer cases.Now, even more women are expected to abandon the pills. And doctors worry that women with severe menopausal symptoms -- who need the treatment -- will deny themselves the benefits hormones can offer.There are ways to take advantage of the benefits, however, and still minimize the risks. One gynecology group shares the following suggestions.   Take the lowest dose for the shortest time -- two or three years if   possible. Start out small and add more medication if symptoms do not decrease.     Do not take hormones to try to prevent heart disease -- because they do   not prevent it.   Never take estrogen without progestin if you still have a uterus. This   raises the risk of uterine cancer.   Try periodically to cut your dose and wean yourself off. For those who don\\'t definitively need hormone therapy, it\\'s important to discontinue use. But some women truly do need the treatment and should not abruptly stop their therapy in light of news that is not definitive in itself.

       " 'The first study showing low-fat diets can prevent breast cancer recurrence now reveals -- thanks to longer follow-up -- that the benefit was almost exclusive to women whose tumor growth was not fueled by hormones.Trimming fat translated into a 66 percent lower risk of death for these women. One doctor with no role in the study says this is \"as great or better than any treatment intervention that we\\'ve given\" for this type of cancer, which is notoriously hard to treat. As with all studies relating to diet, however, there is always the possibility that the benefit stems from something other than an altered diet -- like increased intake of other foods like fruits and vegetables, weight loss, or better overall health that accompanies the decrease in fat.For women whose cancers are driven by hormones -- the majority of breast cancer patients fall into this category -- the diet change seemed to make little difference in the risk of recurrence or survival. This finding comes as a surprise to many health professionals who expected all women to benefit from a cut in fat consumption.A new study to test weight loss, increased exercise, and low-fat diets in women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer will launch in the United States and Canada next year. Comments: 1. I saw this interesting and encouraging news in the newspaper on Sunday and have already passed it on to two patients I know. However, it is not clear what types of fats were involved, and that can make a difference. In prostate cancer, it\\'s not a low fat diet we strive for, it\\'s a diet low in saturated fat, while consuming a reasonable amount of good fat such as from olive oil, certain nuts and fish.It\\'s great that a low-fat diet aided patients whose breast cancer did not depend on hormones, but is it possible that women whose cancers do depend on hormones might benefit from a diet low in saturated fat but not low in mono and poly unsaturated fats?Jim Waldenfels (web site: <A href=\"http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147\" rel=nofollow>http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147</A>)2. Hi Jacki, This is great news for me, but I want to find out more about the study. Can you give me more information about the study so I can follow up? Yours is the only post I\\'ve seen on it. Thanks! Megan3. Two big news items this week. One, the results of a study in which post surgical patients with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer were randomized to a diet, in which one arm of the study reduced their percent calories as fat to 20% or less. These women had a 2/3 drop in mortality, which vastly exceeds that produced by any other therapeutic modality.The other big news is a lesser drop in mortality in Her2/neu positive patients randomized to Herceptin. This is being puffed up as the breast cancer breakthrough of the century, but it\\'s much less important than the diet study.Herceptin will make billions for various people. Reducing fat in the diet would save cancer patients money, cost the \"sytem\" nothing at all, and make no money for anyone. Now, for $64,000...the envelope, please. Which study will have the greatest impact on the medical practices of medical oncologists?4. Women who ate the low-fat diet lost an average of 5â\\x80\\x936 pounds. \"It (the benefit) could be the result of either the reduction in dietary fat or the weight loss that accompanied the low-fat diet.And the excellent news about Herceptin:<A href=\"http://professional.cancerconsultants.com/oncology_main_news.aspx?id=38789\" rel=nofollow>http://professional.cancerconsultants.com/oncology_main_news.aspx?id=38789</A>5. Women with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cut their recurrence rate by 60% if they stayed with a diet in which fewer than 20% of calories were from fat. Nothing else has ever achieved results like that before. Not chemo. Not radiation. If you are ever diagnosed with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer, you can either wait 20 years for another diet intervention study that will give you the proof beyond reasonable doubt, or you can cut your chance of cancer recurrence by 60% by cutting the fat in your diet by 30%.',\n",

The winning Canadian drug combinations -- EC/T (epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel) and CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil) -- are reportedly more effective at preventing breast cancer recurrence than AC/T.About 2,104 women in Canada and the United States participated in this international study. All had undergone surgery to remove a tumor and were receiving chemotherapy. The women, aged 60 and under, all had cancer that had spread to their lymph nodes, indicating the disease was likely to spread.The women received one of three treatments -- AC/T, EC/T, or CEF -- and results revealed that for every 100 women who received EC/T or CEF, 10 women would suffer a recurrence. For every 100 women who received AC/T, 15 women would relapse.The lead researcher of the study says it's too soon to say whether EC/T and CEF are more effective in the long-term. So participants will be followed for some time while researchers will try to make sense of their initial findings. In the meantime, they suspect AC/T will continue to be widely used because of its lesser side effects. Comments: \",\n",

Judge examined him, referred him for an ultrasound, and learned with Kessel that the lump was in fact cancer -- embryonal testicular cancer.

In this one family, the gene was mutated and produced large amounts of a misshapen protein that rolls like tumbleweed through the body, migrating 50 percent faster than other cells.Scientists hope to translate their research findings into a diagnostic test to find excess amounts of the protein and to prevent the cancer cells from moving.

Menopause treatments we know about them and the harmful effects, young women with painful periods and the drastic treatments for that problem. Synthetic Hormone Injections you are told may cause you to develop Breast Cancer in later life. What is wrong with the more natural methods, diet, exercise, relaxtion techniques,yoga, there are herbal treatments which do less harm. We rely on quick fixes these days instead of putting a bit of hard work and discipline in our own lives to fix our own ailments. We will continue to get cancer with all the chemical additives in personal care products and artificial treatments to fix every ailment we suffer from. Menopause is only another stage in our lives, it is not to be feared but embraced. We need to take charge of our own destiny instead of putting it in the hands of someone else with drastic consequences. Read books such as written by Sherrill Sellman \"Hormone Heresy\", and \"Mothers Don\\'t Let Your Daughters Get Breast Cancer\". 3. A Dr George Carlo who wrote the book \"Cell Phones The Invisible Hazards of a Wirless Age\" has proven in his book the dangers of electro magnetic radiation produced from mobile phones. These frequencies are all around us and these young women working under a large transmitting tower such as the one above the ABC Studios were always at risk. These frequencies are in the wiring in the walls and are radiated through computers and the like. If you want to find out more go in to George Carlo\\'s website support@safewireless.org there are answers and companies now addressing these problems which will very soon become even more apparent. There will have to be warning labels on mobile phones and wireless products as more cancers such as brain cancer come to light. The breast would be the most vulnerable part being subjected to these frequencies every day, using computers and possibly sound boards. It would be like having a mammogram every day. Dr Carlo is fighting the war against cancer every day in his research.4. Again I ask, what is the history of the ABC studios property? It would be relatively easy and inexpensive to get a history of the land use. Has the research been done? If not, why not?

       " \"Some women opt to remove their ovaries to prevent breast cancer recurrence. I considered it -- and then decided I would not take such an extreme measure when I wasn't all that sure I was done having children.Now, ovary removal may not be necessary -- because a new chemical equivalent of surgery allows women to temporarily shut down their ovaries while preserving their fertility.The shutdown of the ovaries is called chemopause, and women who choose to go this route receive monthly injections -- considered a super-hormone treatment -- of a drug that blocks the male hormone testosterone and is often used to treat prostate cancer. Chemopause has big advantages. It doesn't require surgery. And it's not permanent. Women who want to have children can stop the treatment in order to conceive. And women who have trouble with side effects can discontinue use of the surgery-sparing drugs.The ovary-suppressing drugs -- triptorelin, goserelin, leuprolide, and buserelin -- can be used in place of or on top of standard chemotherapy and hormone therapy and are showing promise in their ability to decrease incidences of breast cancer recurrence.Medical professionals agree there is value in ovarian suppression. Studies show women whose periods do not return after chemotherapy -- which often causes early menopause -- have lower relapse rates than women whose periods resume. So shutting down the ovaries and stopping menstruation may not be such a bad idea -- and not such an extreme measure either. Comments: \",\n",

Thompson's portrayal of Vivian Bearing, Ph.D., professor of 17th-century English poetry, and expert on the sonnets of John Donne, was entirely real -- so real I sometimes felt I was reliving my own journey with cancer.The cold, impersonal delivery of Bearing's treatment plan -- eight high-dose, experimental chemotherapy treatments taken over the course of eight months for stage-four metastatic ovarian cancer, an aggressive and advanced form -- reminded me of the matter-of-fact manner in which doctors speak to patients, the manner in which my own oncologist spoke to me, void of compassion and warmth and concern.The on-going sterile and clinical interactions Bearing encounters from doctors, technicians, nurses, and medical students allowed me to appreciate the very few caring souls who crossed my medical path.Bearing resolves to become a scholar on cancer, just as she has on Donne. And while I am no Ph.D. scholar, I did study cancer, sometimes to a fault, in order to acquire some sort of control over what was happening to me.Chemotherapy makes Bearing sick. It made me sick too. Chemotherapy lands Bearing in hospital isolation. It landed me there too. Cancer scares Bearing. It scared me too.Sometimes, cancer -- the return of cancer -- still scares me. But mostly, I am happy to be alive, happy to be watching movies that authentically capture the reality of cancer, movies that make me proud to have overcome what Bearing's doctor calls an insidious disease.

       " 'I spend 10.5 hours every weekday on my own with some combination of my two little boys. My day starts each morning and extends through meals and playtime and laughs and tears and fights and struggles and snuggles -- but never a nap -- and even a part-time preschool job where one or two boys always tag along. Sometimes I try to write during the day while my boys are happy and occupied. Typically, I don\\'t accomplish much. Interruptions are endless -- as they should be for a mostly stay-at-home mom who chooses to devote her daytime hours to raising children.And so I go it alone until dinner time when my husband returns from work and selflessly takes over and sets me free. He cooks, serves, and cleans up dinner. He plays and entertains and wrestles and heads up bath and book time. And then he transports each boy on his back to their respective beds.During my moments of freedom each evening, I lose myself in my thoughts -- and I begin to write. I love my mommy job -- and wouldn\\'t trade it for any other full-time job -- but I also love being alone. And I love writing. Helen Keller said, \"I must have something besides husband and children, something I can devote myself to! I want to go on living even after my death! And therefore, I am grateful to God for giving me this gift, this possibility of developing myself, and of writing, of expressing all that is within me.\"Writing -- mostly about cancer -- helps me develop my surviving self. It helps me express all that is within me. And maybe it\\'s fitting that I don\\'t get too much time to dwell on the disease that consumed me for two years. If I had to choose between two busy boys and a life busy with cancer, I\\'d take two boys in an instant. At the end of the day, a little bit of writing about a little of cancer suits me just fine.

       " \"I've always been a fan of the Chicken Soup for the Soul books. I've been touched, motivated, inspired and brought to tears by the short stories that lie between the covers of these books -- stories that dive into the depths of family and parenthood and work and teaching and death and religion and even cooking. They warm my heart and rejuvenate my spirit. It's been a while since I've read one of these books, though -- it's been a while since I've read any book lately -- and I think I need another serving of chicken soup. Chicken Soup for the Surviving Soul is exactly what I need.I've been surviving breast cancer for more than a year now -- and soon, I will be surviving all on my own. My treatment will end in July, and I'm a bit concerned about this -- living free of the medical maze and just waiting and wondering if cancer will pay me a return visit. Some people say surviving can be toughest leg of a cancer journey. So I am prepared for some difficult moments and plan to look to other survivors for advice and wisdom. This book should be a good start -- it includes 101 stories about those who are surviving cancer. And if I am in the market for more chicken soup, there is another book specifically for breast cancer survivors -- Chicken Soup for the Breast Cancer Survivors Soul. There are also books on menopause, weight loss, diabetes, heart disease, stress and overall health -- all are part of the Chicken Soup for the Soul Healthy Living Series. I am ready for my own personal serving of chicken soup -- and Chicken Soup for Surviving Soul is at the top of my list. Comments: \",\n",

It was this Cancer Blog that drew us together. She left a comment on one of my posts, I sent her a personal e-mail, and swiftly, our friendship blossomed.I met my newest cancer friend this weekend -- face-to-face, up close and personal. It was lovely. We talked about chemotherapy -- she just completed her second treatment -- and wigs and radiation and about how our husbands and children cope with cancer. We talked for more than an hour, and then went our separate ways.And now we are back to e-mail correspondence and our shared hope -- that we will one day meet again, to talk about more than just breast cancer.

       " \"The build-up to 2006 was a bit uncertain for me. At the end of 2004, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and set my sights on short-term survival, moment by moment, day by day. I wasn't sure 2005 -- in its entirety -- was a guarantee so I tried not to look too far ahead. I focused on the completion of each of the year's cancer steps -- surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, the beginning of a year-long Herceptin therapy, and so much more -- and somehow, I survived the whole ordeal. And the whole year.I made it through 2005, and I have almost made it through 2006 -- a year marked by a cancer slow-down, a more normal existence. Moment by moment, day by day, the burden of cancer loosened it's grip on me. And as I begin to reflect on the year that has all but passed before my eyes, I realize it turned out just fine. Here are seven reasons why.   On May 19, 2006, my very first post published on The Cancer Blog. What a   thrill it was -- and still is -- to find myself engaged in a useful pursuit as   a result of my own cancer experience.   On June 28, 2006, the last drops of Herceptin made their way through my   body, marking the conclusion of 17 doses of this hopefully life-saving potion.     On September 15, 2006, my port came out, signaling my acceptance of a life   without drug treatment, my faith that I will never again need a foreign object   sewn under my skin.   On December 6, 2006, 18 months of counseling came to a close. Armed with   skills to cope with all sorts of emotional issues, I am marching forward, free   of the disabling anxiety and free-flowing tears that first landed me in the   counseling chair.   For much of 2006, I have been a student of fitness training, pushing   myself physically in search of better health. It's not always easy, I'm not   always motivated, and I am known to whine a bit -- but still, I am happier   just knowing I am working toward sustained health.   Throughout the entire year, I have walked away from every medical check-up   and follow-up with a clean bill of health. I hear the longer someone survives   cancer, the less likely the disease is to return. Happily, I have two years of   survival under my belt.   Ever since my diagnosis, I have been reaching for others with journeys   similar to mine. First, I reached for support and guidance and reassurance.   Then, I reached to offer my own version of support and guidance and   reassurance. The year 2006 has been full of rich connections, found only   because of cancer. Reaching makes me feel good. Yes, the year 2006 turned out just fine. Comments: 1. I hope 2007 makes you even happier. Thank you for sharing your experiences.2. Yes, thank you for sharing and for helping those who came after you. Your caring and always informative dialogue has kept me going over this past year. When I wasn't sure if I could make it through emotionally you asked me to interview as a survivor. And survive this year I did. Merry Christmas to you and your family. I wish only the best for you in the new year and all the years to come.\",\n",
       " 'It has just recently been discovered that CT scans for children have been inappropriately used in two Ontario hospitals. As a result, some children have received excessive doses of radiation, putting them at greater risk of developing cancer later in life.Staff at the two hospitals -- Peterborough Regional Health Centre is one -- reported that in close to 50 percent of selected cases, the appropriate equipment settings were not used.Herein lies the problem -- developing organs are more susceptible to damage, and giving a small child an adult dose of radiation in a CT scan delivers the same amount of radiation as 4,000 traditional X-rays. Research shows that increased exposure to radiation over time can cause radiation-induced cancer.CT scans are valuable diagnostic tools because they create 3-D images of organs, offering a better view of head injuries, chest trauma, cancer, and fractures. So they should not be disregarded -- but clearly, hospitals need to improve the management of all scanning procedures.In Ontario, a diagnostic image safety committee has already been formed. The goal of this committee is to develop standards and do a better job of tracking radiation levels.Experts are encouraging Ontario parents to refrain from worry unless their children have received many CT scans. And all parents are encouraged to speak up before their children receive CT scans. \"Is my child receiving a pediatric protocol?\" is all it takes. Comments: ',\n",

       " 'For 20 years, commentator Debra Jarvis has been dealing with cancer as a hospital chaplain. Last year, she herself was diagnosed with breast cancer. And she quickly discovered whenever she brought up the topic of her diagnosis, all people wanted to talk about was her hair.Cancer is not about the hair, she says, but it\\'s the first thing people seem to talk about.\"There goes the hair,\" one friend said to Jarvis just after her diagnosis. She was trying to be light and funny. Jarvis didn\\'t find any humor in the comment -- but she did start to think about the whole preoccupation with hair, and she was able to make some sense of it all.Cancer is really about death. People die from cancer all the time. But it\\'s impolite to ask, are you going to lose your life? So people ask about the hair. When we go bald, we are marked. Our bald head shoves death in the face of those around us. People really hate to think about dying, Jarvis says. So they don\\'t ask, what\\'s your prognosis? That would be too nosy and could lead to uncomfortable discussions. It\\'s safer to ask about the hair.Jarvis concludes that people focus on the hair because it\\'s so hard to talk about fear and pain and grief. But if we can stand to talk about these issues, she says, then when we talk about the hair, it will really be about the hair. Comments: ',\n",
       " 'Kidney transplants can save lives. They can also increase the risk of developing a variety of cancers, according to Australian researchers who report a risk 300 percent higher than in the general population.Most cancers developed in kidney transplant patients have a known or suspected viral origin, suggesting the weakened immune systems in these patients limit protection against cancer. \"The immunosuppressive drugs transplant patients take lower their ability to fight off infections that can trigger malignancy\", the lead researcher said. \"We believe the increased incidence of infection leads to the infection that results in cancer.\" She also notes there is probably an even greater risk of cancer among heart and lung transplant patients because these patients receive more powerful immunosuppressive drugs.Researchers gathered their findings by comparing the incidence of cancer in 29,000 patients with end-stage kidney disease who received kidney transplants. Data was collected beginning five years prior to transplantation, during dialysis, and after transplantation. Researchers then consulted an Australian registry to identify cancers occurring between the years of 1982-2003. They compared the statistics with the number of cancers seen among transplant patients.These cancers included melanoma, Kaposi\\'s sarcoma, non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, Hodgkin\\'s disease, leukemia and cancers of the lip, tongue, mouth, salivary gland, esophagus, stomach, colon, anus, liver, gallbladder, lung, connective and other soft tissue, vulva, cervix, penis, eye and thyroid. There was also an increase in nasal cavity and vaginal cancers.This study has important implications for future immosuppression. Patients should give considerable thought to quality-of-life transplants -- such as face transplants and hand transplants -- and should carefully weigh the risks of weakened immunity. On a brighter note, this study might help prompt research on medication that can selectively target the part of the body responsible for rejecting a transplant. Because right now, medications affect the entire immune system -- and this is what makes patients more prone to developing cancer. Comments: ',\n",

He was treated with surgery and moved on. Cancer didn\\'t overshadow anything. But that cancer was different than the cancer now invading his lungs, spine, and brain.

       " 'Despite tensions between the United States and the Middle East, Laura Bush announced Monday a plan to raise breast cancer awareness in the Middle East -- first with partnerships with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia and later with Morocco and Jordan. Joining forces also with the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, and Johns Hopkins Medical Center, the First Lady outlined a plan that will allow governments, hospitals, researchers, and survivors to work globally to defeat breast cancer. Campaigns specific to each country will target research, training, and community-outreach programs. The reason for this partnership -- to raise awareness in countries where women are too embarrassed or too uninformed to seek treatment -- stems from compassion and human decency and a desire to form diplomatic friendships too. Laura Bush, whose own mother is a breast cancer survivor, shared that the tragedy of losing a loved one to breast cancer -- and the joy of watching a loved one survive this same disease -- is felt universally. Breast cancer affects all women in all countries. Borders make no difference in this matter. And helping save lives is the right thing to do. Comments: ',\n",

       " \"I went out to lunch with my husband and kids yesterday. Sitting right behind us in the restaurant was a woman wearing a white hat, worn to mask an obvious bald head. My two little boys kept watching this woman, my littlest turning in his seat to get the best possible view. These boys, ages five and three, were not looking at this woman because a bald head is an odd sight in a public venue. They were looking because, to them, a bald head is familiar. And I think they were sizing up this woman, recalling what I once cleverly hid -- my own bald head.We all noticed the woman in her white hat. But we handled our observations differently. My husband chose to focus on the task at hand -- eating. My boys chose to stare. I chose to contemplate.I contemplated talking to this woman. I always have this urge -- to talk with others I suspect are fighting cancer -- and I always wonder if it's appropriate to approach strangers to discuss such a personal topic. Do I have a free pass to enter another's cancer world because I myself have membership in the same world? Perhaps. Perhaps not. So when faced with a possible cancer survivor -- marked mostly by a bald head -- I usually hesitate, contemplate, and then do nothing other than quietly consider what life might be like for the person who faces me.Maybe I lack courage and should find a way to connect with these strangers. It may do us all a bit of good. Maybe courage has nothing to do with it. Maybe I refrain from conversation out of respect for each person's privacy. I am not convinced either way.For now, I think I'll stick with what works, what feels safe -- observation and contemplation. And maybe next time I'm in a restaurant and notice someone strikingly familiar, I'll take a stab at my husband's approach -- just simply eating. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'Eleven is the magic number. Eleven pounds of lost weight can reduce the risk of an advanced form of prostate cancer, according to researchers from the American Cancer Society and the Duke University Prostate Center.Researchers, who tracked the weight of 70,000 men between 1982 and 1992 and then followed them until 2003, found men who lost more than 11 pounds had a lower risk of developing prostate cancer than men whose weight remained the same. Studies have long shown obese men are at greater risk for prostate cancer. But this study, published in this month\\'s Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention, is the first to indicate that recent weight loss can decrease risk by roughly 40 percent. Comments: 1. Thanks, Jacki, for posting this most interesting study. Your tip motivated me to read the full story and check the abstract itself in PubMed. I have a hunch this is one of those studies that is going to affect the thinking of many researchers, physicians and patients. The bottom line finding, quoting from the abstract: \"Obesity increases the risk of more aggressive prostate cancer and may decrease either the occurrence or the likelihood of diagnosis of less-aggressive tumors. Men who lose weight may reduce their risk of prostate cancer.\" I found this particularly useful because the relationship of obesity and prostate cancer had been confusing to me, and because the study was based on a very large group (69,991 men in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort) followed for a long time (1982 through June 30, 2003) among whom 5,252 prostate cancers had been found (excluding the first two years of follow-up, no doubt to minimize the number of men who already had cancer at the start). I was confused because Dr. Myers, Dr. Moyad and other leading communicators about nutrition, diet, supplements, lifestyle and prostate cancer stress the connection of obesity and prostate cancer, yet, when I surveyed studies for myself in PubMed, sometimes obesity seemed to actually cut the risk. The researchers appear to have found the answer: obesity cut either the ability to detect and/or the risk of low-grade prostate cancer a bit (best estimate is an 84% risk compared to non-obese or overall total group risk, I\\'m not sure which), but increases the risk of nonmetastatic high-grade prostate cancer by 22% (with the high confidence range that the true percent increase is between 96% and 155%). That confidence range convinces me that there is a substantial increase in risk.The major finding was that men who had lost more than 11 pounds between 1982 and 1992 were at a decreased risk of nonmetastatic high-grade prostate cancer, which was the point you highlighted in your blog. The researchers based their obesity indicator on Body Mass Index, which has some flaws. For instance, people with a lot of muscle score higher than they should, judging by true obesity, on the BMI scale. However, BMI seems to me to be valid enough to support the findings of this study.I wondered why they were not mentioning men diagnosed with metastatic disease. I suspect the answer is that this group was monitored often enough that metastatic disease did not have time to develop or was excluded when they dropped those diagnosed with prostate cancer in the first two years of follow-up, a tactic that is useful in order to minimize those who already had cancer at the start, as mentioned above.I have kept my body weight and fat under fairly good control, but this news and clarification of the relationship of body fat and aggressive cancer motivates me to make a special effort to lose some pounds.Thanks again,Jim (web site: <A href=\"http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147\" rel=nofollow>http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147</A> )',\n",

       " 'Calorie counting may be a bit tedious for some -- like me -- but for others, it may be just the ticket for the management of weight and overall health.Charles Stuart Platkin, author of the new book The Diet Detective\\'s Count Down, takes calorie counting one step further and offers the exercise equivalent of a nutritional label. His 341-page book offers charts that detail the number of calories, fats, and carbohydrates in more than 7,500 foods and drinks and then translates these details into what it takes, in terms of minutes, to burn the calories with walking, running, biking, swimming, yoga, or dance.Platkin, a syndicated nutrition and fitness columnist, says he is not trying to encourage people to count every calorie consumed in a day and to exercise until each calorie melts away. His goal is to help those who exceed their daily calorie budget -- the number of calories they can eat each day without gaining weight.The Count Down goes like this -- you consume one martini at your New Year\\'s celebration, pushing you beyond your allotted calories for the day. All you have to do is walk it off the next day in a mere 71 minutes. Or you can run it off in just 39 minutes. If a single cracker with one slice of Genoa salami and cheese tempts your palate, go for it -- then plunge into a 55-minute yoga class.Before taking a stab at the diet detective\\'s approach, there are several considerations to take into account. First, the book is based on a 155-pound person. A person carrying more weight would burn more calories per minute, and a person carrying less weight would burn less. Second, a person\\'s basal metabolic rate (BMR) must be calculated -- Platkin offers formulas for this task -- so it\\'s clear how much activity output is required by each person. And third, the exercise equivalents are based on scientifically researched metabolic equivalent tables that try to measure what is being burned versus a person\\'s resting metabolic rate. So this is not just a crazy gimmick. It\\'s science -- with a touch of personal perspective too.Platkin, clinically obese for most of his life, lost 50 pounds a few years ago and came to realize that people just don\\'t know what a calorie is. He wishes the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) would include exercise recommendations on food labels and says, \"I think that we are so confused in general as a population as to what\\'s healthy and what\\'s not, we confuse the term healthy with low-calorie. Sometimes they don\\'t mesh. There\\'s so much confusion out there that I think that it needs to be more defined. We need to have some sort of reference points so that people can make decisions before they consume.\"Until the FDA delivers on Platkin\\'s wish, he is taking matters into his own hands for those who choose to borrow from his wisdom.Some of his wisdom includes eating calorie bargains (air-popped popcorn) instead of calorie rip-offs (potato chips) and substituting mustard for mayonnaise on a burger -- it will save 2,000 calories per month for someone who eats fast food three times per week.Platkin\\'s hope is simple -- he wants people to ask themselves whether certain foods are worth the cost. Is it worth a 54-minute run to burn the 510 calories in a McDonald\\'s Quarter Pounder with Cheese? How about a 144-minute walk to rid yourself of a Subway six-inch Meatball Marinara sandwich? It\\'s a worthy hope, I think -- although this method is still a bit tedious for me. I think I will stick with my own formula -- eating moderate portions of what I enjoy and intensely exercising several times per week. I don\\'t need to know how many calories I am consuming. I don\\'t even need to know how much I weigh. As long as my clothes fit and my fitness routine keeps me sweating, I\\'ll be a happy girl. Comments: 1.

       " 'The combination of breast cancer drugs Tykerb and Xeloda are effective at slowing the progression of metastatic breast cancer after the drug Herceptin fails -- but the drug duo is only effective at extending the lives of patients for a few months, according to the results of a recent international clinical trial.The trial, led by Charles E. Geyer, M.D., of Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh and published in the December 28 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, focused on 324 women whose breast cancer had spread to other organs. The women had already been treated with Herceptin for a median of 42-44 weeks -- and then half received Xeloda chemotherapy and half received both Xeloda and Tykerb.Women who received the drug combination had more than a 50 percent delay in disease progression. Their cancer spread after a median 8.4 months, compared to 4.4 months for women who received only Xeloda.Targeted drugs Herceptin and Tykerb are major advances in the fight against breast cancer -- for the 20 percent of diagnosed women with the aggressive HER2 positive disease -- and they are also quite expensive. While some say they are worth every penny if they offer a cure, others question the cost if they only delay the disease progression for a few months. Such was the case in this study.Perhaps the greatest potential for these agents is for use before breast cancer spreads, when they may improve the chance for a cure. Comments: 1. In cell culture photomicrographs, the microscopic slides sometime show that the exact same identical individual culture well, shows some clusters have taken up vast amounts of a drug, while right next door, clusters of the same size, same appearance, same everything haven\\'t taken up any of the drug.It doesn\\'t matter if there is a \"target\" molecule in the cell that the targeted drug is going after, if the drug either won\\'t \"get in\" in the first place or if it gets pumped out/extruded or if it gets immediately metabolized inside the cell, drug resistance is multifactorial.These \"smart\" drugs are a really exciting element of cancer medicine, but do not work for everyone, and a test to determine the efficacy of these drugs in a patient could be the first crucial step in personalizing treatment to the individual.2. Here\\'s a PS:While Phase III trials take a while to complete and report, there is ongoing work with at least one of these drugs that is being reported at conferences in abstracts, a method of publication that is usually below the radar of PubMed. I looked up both of them in the Proceedings (set of abstracts of posters and presentations) of the last national conference of the American Association for Cancer Research (April 2006) and found one of the drugs (capecitabine) listed seven times in the index. You can look up these abstracts at the AACR site, www.aacr.org, abstract #s 5322, 5320, 3119, 2145, 513, 403, and 2150.Jim3. While the benefit appears small - a four month delay in progression,it is clear that the impact was real. Here are two key encouragingpoints:First, the median advantage in progression was 4 months,meaning that some patients did much better. For those patients, thiscombination could be invaluable. Now researchers can work ondetermining who will be an excellent responder and who will not,hopefully enabling efficient targetting of this therapy, which isGreg\\'s point in comment #1 about personalizing therapy.Second, theresults remind me of the results for docetaxel plus prednisone versusmitoxantrone plus prednisone, the standard therapy, for prostatecancer patients at a certain advanced stage (no longer responding tohormonal blockade therapy)(Tannock IF...Eisenberger MA, NEJM, 2004). The advantage over the standard therapy was proven, but was small; pera key line from the results: \"The median survival was 16.5 months inthe mitoxantrone group, 18.9 months in the group given docetaxelevery 3 weeks, and 17.4 months in the group given weekly docetaxel.\" The conclusion: \"When given with prednisone, treatment with docetaxelevery three weeks led to superior survival and improved rates ofresponse in terms of pain, serum PSA level, and quality of life, ascompared with mitoxantrone plus prednisone.\"So what was gained forthis arguably meager response? For one thing, a new and betterstandard emerged. For another, researchers had a new promising agentwith which to work, one at least as good, in fact better, than thethen current approach, as well as a benchmark for then ongoing PhaseII work (led by T Beer) headed toward Phase III (now known as the ASCENT trial), andfor other such similar research. In the Beer Phase II study ofdocetaxel plus calcitriol, published in 2003, the response rate (atleast a 50% reduction in PSA) was 81%, much better than for thedocetaxel plus prednisone Phase three work: \"Among these threegroups, 32 percent, 45 percent, and 48 percent of men, respectively,had at least a 50 percent decrease in the serum PSA level....\"This is a long way of saying that a proven four month advantage can mean a lot in oncology research.Jim (website: <A href=\"http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147\" rel=nofollow>http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147</A> )4. The heterogeneity of cancer means that a particular drug will rarely be effective against all tumors of a particular type, and the degree of efficacy will vary between patients.Also, as a result of their original mutations, many tumor cells acquire the ability to adapt rapidly to changes in their environment, sometimes by further mutation, often by molecular changes which induce resistance to the drugs used to treat them. Further courses of chemotherapy then select for resistant cells, and the treatment eventually fails to control the tumor.To overcome the problems of heterogeneity and prevent rapid cellular adaptation, oncologists need to tailor chemotherapy to individual patients. This is done by testing the tumor cells to see if they are susceptible to particular drugs, before giving them to the patient.Improving cancer patient diagnosis and treatment through a combination of cellular and gene-based testing will offer predictive insight into the nature of an individual\\'s particular cancer and enable oncologists to prescribe treatment more in keeping with the heterogeneity of the disease. The biologies are very different and the response to given drugs is very different.5. Monoclonal Antibodies Vs.Tyrosine Kinase InhibitorsTargeted cancer therapies use drugs that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific molecules involved in carcinogenesis (the process by which normal cells become cancer cells) and tumor growth. By focusing on molecular and cellular changes that are specific to cancer, targeted cancer therapies may be more effective than current treatments and less harmful to normal cells.However, the monoclonal antibodies are \"large\" molecules that attach to specific proteins on the \"outside\" of cancer cells, not having a convenient way of getting access to a large majority of the targeted cells. There is multicellular resistance, the drugs affecting only the cells on the outside may not kill these cells if they are in contact with cells on the inside, which are protected from the drug. The cells may pass small molecules back and forth.Exciting results have come from studies of multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, \"small\" molecules that act on multiple receptors in the cancerous cells. But, is something more elemental going on? Does the drug even enter the cell? Once entered, does it immediately get metabolized or pumped out, or does it accumulate? Some clones of tumor cells don\\'t accumulate the drug. These cells won\\'t get killed by it. Are the cells ultimately killed, or aren\\'t they?Each of these new targeted drugs are not for everybody (just like conventional cancer drugs are not for everybody). Even when the disease is the same type, different patients\\' tumors respond differently to the same agents. As the saying goes, \"don\\'t throw out the baby with the bath water.\" If a drug works extremely well for only 10% of cancer patients, identify which 10%. If one drug or another is working for \"some\" people (not average populations), then obviously there are others out there who would also benefit.6. Even if Xeloda and Tykerb only add an average of 4 months to the patients life it is still worth the cost (whatever that may be). My wife has metastatic breast cancer and is currently taking Xeloda and Avastin. At the cost of $1000 per bottle I can see why the insurance companies complain about the cost, but you cannot put a price on human life. 4 extra months of time w/ my wife would be priceless to me.7. Mark, I\\'m so with you. It\\'s a shame that so many medications are beyond the financial reach of a lot of people. But for those with the means... a few extra months must be SO worth it. Not to mention, what if new strides in treatment are made in those few months?Regards,Richard Day Gore8. One must be objective and decide at what point the benefits of drugs truly outweigh the risks they present. Some of the risks are minor and others are tolerable in that they are reversible, short-term or non-life threatening. Many of the risks are extremely serious and are difficult to balance against relief from anything but the most severe symptoms. For some people the risks may be acceptable, for others, not.9. I need to respond to one sentence in the above post:\"While some say they are worth every penny if they offer a cure, others question the cost if they only delay the disease progression for a few months.\"First, Herceptin and these other drugs will not CURE metastatic breast cancer. They can put it into clnical remission, however. And the second half of the sentence about delaying disease progression for ONLY a few months. I\\'ve been on Herceptin, in combination with other drugs, for more than five years now. That\\'s five years of living with metastatic breast cancer with pretty good quality of life. These drugs are absurdly expensive, however.

       " 'Catherine Jones has breast cancer. And she needs Herceptin in order to fight for her life. But Herceptin, a targeted drug used to treat HER2 positive breast cancer, is very expensive -- and for some time, Jones was not sure how she could possibly pay for this potentially life-saving therapy.Jones, 49 and a resident of New Plymouth, New Zealand, decided to ask for help. So she set up the Herceptin for Catherine Trust to raise the $80,000 needed for the treatment. In less than four weeks, she received $64,600 in donations.Jones is overwhelmed by the support and says she will continue to use the trust to raise funds -- not just for herself, but for other women in need.The New Zealand government and its drug-buying agency Pharmac does not fund Herceptin. So most breast cancer patients who medically qualify for the treatment have no means of receiving it. Jones, who is about to receive her third of 17 Herceptin doses, thinks she can help. She is surely off to a great start. Comments: ',\n",
       " \"My new breast cancer friend recently sat through her second infusion of Adriamycin and Cytoxan -- the long-time traditional chemotherapy combination for breast cancer -- and all the while, listened to another breast cancer survivor share her thoughts on these two drugs. This woman told my friend she opted to stray from these chemotherapy agents because of their toxic side effects, because of their combined potential for causing other cancers, like leukemia. She instead took another drug route and was happy for her decision. My friend, however, was scared.My friend returned home from her treatment and found herself reading a Cancer Blog post reporting that Adriamycin and Cytoxan may no longer be the gold standard treatment for breast cancer, that Taxotere and Cytoxan may become the preferred, safer option. Fear and panic set in, and my friend e-mailed me, in search of perspective from a recipient of the drugs she was starting to believe are both ineffective and cancer-causing.I am not a doctor. I am not an expert. I am not qualified in any way to represent the facts about medical research. But I am surviving breast cancer. And I did spend eight difficult weeks under the influence of Adriamycin and Cytoxan, given every two weeks in a dose-dense fashion. So I have an opinion about these drugs -- and about most things breast cancer related.I shared my opinion with my friend, who has since decided to proceed with her prescribed treatment plan. I told her that in rare cases, chemotherapy can cause a second cancer, like leukemia. But this is not common, and the unlikely risk does not outweigh the benefit of receiving chemotherapy to address the cancer at hand.I also shared with my friend that we can only benefit from therapies that are available and effective at the time of our treatment. Studies prove that Adriamycin and Cytoxan work -- that's why so many women are treated with this accepted method. Drugs in the research pipeline may one day definitively replace what is available today. But we must be OK with what we receive -- because we have no control over what lies ahead. We must live in the here and now -- with the knowledge that should our cancers return, bigger and better options may await us.Consider Herceptin. Once not even an option for women with aggressive HER2 positive breast cancer, this targeted drug may be the magic bullet in an attack against this disease. I received Herceptin. My friend will receive Herceptin. Timing was on our side for this medical breakthrough.Timing may not have been on our side should a new gold-standard drug treatment emerge and replace Adriamycin and Cytoxan. But we can still trust these two drugs will do their jobs, will prevent a recurrence of a disease that is so much more treatable today than it was years ago. Lucky for us. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"Women with ovulation disorders -- and related infertility problems -- have a lower risk of developing breast cancer, according to a study of more than 116,000 women.Researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston studied data from the Nurses' Health Study II and evaluated female nurses aged 25 to 42, tracking them every two years beginning in 1989 and ending in 2001.Results of the study, reported in the Archives of Internal Medicine, revealed 1,357 diagnosed cases of invasive breast cancer. Overall, women with ovulation disorders had a 25 percent less chance of developing this disease than those without the disorder. Also detected was an even lower risk of breast cancer for women who experienced induced ovulation for treatment of infertility. This is potentially great news -- pending more research, of course -- for women worried about breast cancer implications of infertility treatment. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'I clearly remember reading a pamphlet about a test that might determine with pretty good accuracy whether or not I would benefit from chemotherapy for breast cancer. This was more than a year ago and I hoped, prayed, wished upon a star that I would be a candidate for this test -- and that the result would reveal that I did not need the toxic chemotherapy that I feared with every fiber of my being. But I did not qualify for this test because it\\'s only effective for tumors that are estrogen receptor positive -- and I am negative. So I received chemotherapy and while I\\'ve survived it, there still remains an important issue -- did I need it?Tens of thousands of women receive chemotherapy every year when many of them don\\'t really need it. But doctors cannot accurately predict who needs aggressive and harsh treatment so they take the cautious route and treat many women who may not benefit -- and may actually suffer long-term side effects -- from this drug therapy. For women like me, who are estrogen receptor negative, this quandary remains -- and I will never know for sure if I really needed my own chemotherapy. But for those whose tumors are fueled by hormones, the Oncotype DX test -- which in the year since I first read about it, has gained even more attention -- can detect with some degree of certainty the chance that a woman\\'s cancer will recur. If the chance is high -- determined by the test and supporting pathology criteria -- chemotherapy could be warranted. If the chance is low, the breast cancer patient may be spared the torture of this possibly-unnecessary treatment.Scoring works like this -- 21 different genes from a surgically-removed tumor are studied for interactions that can predict a relapse. A recurrence score greater than 30 makes chemotherapy a safe bet and can increase 10-year survival from 61 to 88 percent. A score of less than 18 indicates that chemotherapy will make no difference in survival rates. The middle scores -- between 18 and 30 -- present a problem. It still is not clear what treatment path women is this gray area should travel.So there are shortcomings -- women who are estrogen receptor negative and women who are estrogen receptor positive and score between 18 and 30 still may receive the toxic cocktails they do not need. But many women will receive as a result of this test the news of a lifetime -- that chemo is not necessary and that it may actually do more harm than good. And that is what I call progress. Comments: 1. In words of nearly the same meaning, I\\'ve been saying the same thing on the internet for six years now. \"Some tumors send out microscopic outposts while most do not. However, oncologists cannot tell which ones do, so they want to give chemotherapy in nearly every case.\"Now there is finally a test, in breast cancer at least, for most women to know they don\\'t really need chemotherapy. This new guideline can help doctors pick who really needs it. \"Breast cancer (as well as most cancers) has different causes, arise from different types of cells, is driven by different genes, and tends to be different in women before or after menopause, so \\'one-drug(s)-fits-all\\' is not the solution,\" says Dr. Robert Carlson, one of the physicians who led a guideline-writing group.Dr. Larry Norton, breast cancer chief at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, compares it (Oncotype DX) to lab tests that pinpoint a germ so the right antibiotic can be prescribed, called Bacterial Culture and Sensitivity Testing. (see Chemosensitivity Testing)Oncotype DX has the same data for predictive \"accuracy\" of Cell Culture Drug Resistance Testing (CCDRT), which was the only data to validate the Oncotype DX test in the first place, which wasn\\'t a prospective study. The Oncotype DX test hasn\\'t been independently validated by any more than the original laboratory group which published the results.The Journal of Clinical Oncology had published three comprehensive reviews, all of which were largely the exact same paper in which there was no consideration whatsoever of the only type of data which existed to validate any other laboratory test.If documented clinical \"efficacy\" is going to be the standard to be demanded of non-proprietary laboratory tests, then clinicians should abandon all tests currently used in their practices. None of the available laboratory tests used in the selection of treatment for cancer patients have ever been tested for \"efficacy.\" This includes estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, Her2/neu, immunohistochemical staining for tumor classification, Bacterial Culture and Sensitivity testing, CT, MRI and Pet Scans to measure tumor response to treatment, and cell culture assays. The only data supporting any of them relate to test \"accuracy,\" and there is a total lack of information regarding test \"efficacy\" (randomized trials with outcome measurements for diagnostic tests).No one is seriously proposing that any of the molecular tests now available (Oncotype DX, EGFR amplification/mutation) should have to be proven \"efficacious,\" as opposed to merely \"accurate,\" before they are used in clinical decisions regarding treatment selection.All these laboratory tests are a tool for the oncologist. The oncologist should take advantage of all the tools available to him/her to treat a patient. And since studies show that only 25-30% of patients do respond to chemotherapy that is available to them, there should be due consideration to looking at the advantage of using these tests.In virtually all forms of cancer, clinical trials have failed to identify best drug regimens for use in all individuals with a given form of cancer. There should be an expansion of Medicare and private insurance reimbursement to promote even greater utilization and development of laboratory-based mechanisms for improving the match between tumors and an ever-increasing number of partially effective and very expensive drug therapies.2. in 10/05 i had an abnormal mamo, followed by all the tests, doctor visits and repeat tests. my test did come out positive and the very first thought was oh no CHEMO. i had the surgery in 12/05 and was scheduled for my port. the night before my doctor called and asked to hold off there was a test he wanted me to do(i really complained alot, i didn\\'t want to do chemo and let him know at every visit, but i would do it if necessary, i had just watched my friend and uncle go through chemo)he explained about the oncogenetic test and i was more than ready , i felt like i was just pardoned at the 11th hour, i wasn\\'t even worried about the delay with the insurance would cause. the test indicated i would have a 20% benefit with chemo, that wasn\\'t worth it to me and opted out, i did have radition for the full course which gave me a 10% benefit. at odd moments i wonder if i did the right thing not using all therapies available to me but on the whole i think i did the right thing for me, i needed to be working, getting back to my life, my kis needed me etc... etc...

       " 'For 18 months, New Zealand resident Heather Kubiak lived with undiagnosed breast cancer. It was no fault of her own that her disease was left undetected for all this time. It was the fault of the hospital staff who lost her file -- marked urgent -- and thus failed to communicate with her about the cancer living in her body. In December 2003, Kubiak had both breasts removed because her cancer had spread. And so began the battle for her life -- and the battle against a system that admittedly botched up her medical care due to organizational failure.It took years to resolve her claim but earlier this year, Kubiak, a wife and mother of four, received a lump-sum compensation of -- $9,000. That\\'s $16.66 per day for every day of the 18 months her undiagnosed breast cancer continued to spread.It was important for Kubiak to see her hospital held accountable -- and while $9,000 hardly makes up for what she has lost -- she is happy the legal ordeal is over. And she hopes her experience will motivate others to actively pursue their own medical misadventures.\"I do worry for people who aren\\'t articulate enough or strong enough to fight the system because you have to keep on and on,\" she says.

He also remarks on how remarkable it is that chronic myelogenous leukemia is in fact chronic and no longer fatal, thanks to the drug Gleevec.Of course, there is ample attention given to the declining incidence of breast cancer, reportedly due to less women using hormone replacement therapy, and the risks weighing on those who are overweight and obese, and survivors and supporters who gathered for Celebration on the Hill -- the site of one incredible American Cancer Society event.Dr. Len closes his review of 2006 with recognition of three celebrities who lost their lives this year to cancer -- Dana Reeve, Ann Richards, and Ed Bradley. And while he recognizes there are other lives and other stories that deserve mention, there is simply not enough time or space for him to do justice to every noteworthy item.\"What we have seen over the past year is an incredible leap forward in cancer research, diagnosis and treatment, and I suspect there are going to be even more exciting developments in the coming year,\" says Dr. Len who looks forward to 2007 -- a year that is sure to deliver more hope and more progress in the fight against cancer.

       " \"Those of us diagnosed with cancer are not the only survivors of our diseases. Our families and friends and caregivers and even employers and co-workers survive right along with us. Sure, the facets of our survivorship vary tremendously -- but we all survive the wrath of cancer in our own unique ways.My two little boys have spent the past two years surviving breast cancer -- my breast cancer. And while they still don't fully comprehend the magnitude of such a disease, they do understand cancer is a sickness. They understand it took my hair, made me feel sick, left me with scars, and they religiously comment on every pink ribbon they see. They call the ribbons cancer.I am often asked how my children handled my diagnosis, my treatment, my emotions. They handled it all well, I think, and as time passes, they do better and better. In fact, cancer seems to have vanished into thin air for Joey, who will turn six on Wednesday, and Danny, who is three and a half years old. I know this because of their answers to a few questions I asked them last night, on the eve of 2007.What was the best thing you did this year?Joey: Swimming in the pool.Danny: Being at school.What was the worst thing that happened this year?Joey: Getting that boo-boo on my foot, when it scraped on the driveway.Danny: The cheetah that was chasing me.What could you have done better this year?Joey: Learning to ride my bike without training wheels.Danny: Watching Ice Age.What would you like to work on during this new year?Joey: Building a better stick house.Danny: Drinking milk.What was the scariest thing that happened this year?Joey: When I thought there were monsters in my room.Danny: When there was a cheetah in my room.What was the funniest thing that happened to you this year?Joey: When Jack (uncle) and Bud (grandpa) tickled me.Danny: When the cheetah was chasing me.When I say the word Daddy, what do you think about?Joey: Someone who makes me laugh.Danny: no reply -- he was distracted by the movie Ice Age.When I say the word Mommy, what do you think about?Joey: I don't know.Danny: no reply -- still distracted by the movie Ice Age.What do you wish for 2007?Joey: I wish I could fly.Danny: I wish I could slide on a sleigh.And that's a wrap. Not one mention of cancer. Not one response concerning endless medical appointments, my drastically different hair, or the port -- they called it a stone -- that was removed from my body in September. There truly are more important things in life than cancer for two little boys whose memories of a horrible disease will hopefully fade with each passing year -- until not even a pink ribbon catches their attention.Happy 2007, Joey and Danny. May all your wishes come true! Comments: 1. I love you and all of your amazing thoughts and words Jacki. This little story is just like you, funny, sweet, and bright. Thanks for picking me. \",\n",
       " 'Carrying extra weight is a risk factor for developing breast cancer. But it\\'s not been clear how the timing of weight gain affects this risk. Evidence is mounting, though, and it\\'s now believed that weight gain in adult life is more predictive of breast cancer risk than absolute body weight.A new study, published in December\\'s International Journal of Cancer, reveals a link between gaining weight in adulthood and an increased risk of breast cancer after menopause.\"We did find some suggestion that weight gain during the 30s and 40s, weight gain since a woman\\'s first pregnancy and weight gain since menopause, especially for women with a longer time since menopause, may all be of importance in relation to postmenopausal breast cancer risk,\" report the researchers who followed 1,166 women with breast cancer and 2,105 without the disease.A 70 percent increased risk was found among postmenopausal women who gained more than 60 pounds between age 20 and the onset of menopause. This was in comparison to women who gained less than 20 pounds during the same period of time. Overall, there was a four percent increase in breast cancer risk for each 11-pound increase in adult weight. Comments: ',\n",
       " \"2006 will forever be the year linking the decline in breast cancer cases to the decline in use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This was big news on the cancer front, and while some argue other forces helped drive the breast cancer drop, there is still much speculation that the use of HRT somehow increases the risk of developing the disease. Even so, it is predicted that Wyeth's sales of hormone replacement drugs will have reached more than $1 billion as of yesterday, the last day of 2006.Even more interesting is the prediction by analysts that revenue from the pills -- used to treat symptoms of menopause -- will rise five percent annually for the next several years.It seems the sales growth, despite the overall decline in the HRT market, is primarily due to increased demand from wholesalers and price increases too.It's hard to tell what will happen to the world of HRT in the year 2007 -- will women embrace what is considered the best therapy around for menopausal issues? Will they abandon the controversial treatment altogether? Will they find variations of HRT that meet their needs while minimizing risk for disease? Only time will tell. Comments: \",\n",

Once left to each individual to define, manage, and transcend, survivorship is now recognized as a distinct phase of cancer recovery -- just as important, and maybe even more so, than diagnosis and treatment.Linda Griggs, a 13-year breast cancer survivor, clearly remembers the day her chemotherapy ended. With her therapy complete, her hair growing back, and her medical team sending her off to have a nice life, she thought she\\'d be fine. But she wasn\\'t.Three months after her last dose of chemotherapy, Griggs was depressed, consumed with worry about how her cancer might come back. And she realized that the end of treatment is not really the end. It\\'s just the beginning.Griggs told her doctor about her anxiety, about how she was just trying to make it to her next three-month-check up. When her doctor told her, \"that\\'s not living,\" something clicked for Griggs who instantly decided to start living -- really living.Surviving is about self-nurturing, says Griggs, who has created a kit to help others survive cancer. On her website, she writes that there are a couple of other breast cancer survivor kits out there -- containing tissues, herbal teas, meditation tapes, medical appointment books, and breast cancer resource materials. \"This is not that,\" she says of her kit that focuses on the emotional upheaval cancer creates.Griggs\\' kit is full of hands-on creative materials -- like an inner child notebook, complete with magic markers for journaling and expressing emotions. If you\\'re angry, you can write down angry thoughts. If you\\'re sad, write what makes you sad. Save the pages, tear them up, burn them, do what you wish -- but allow your emotions to flow, Griggs says.The kit also includes a wooden box with instructions on how to create a healing shrine, a copy of Griggs\\' non-fiction account of the first five years of her cancer journey, and so much more.Griggs, who also teaches healing workshops, guides others to understand cancer as a hero\\'s quest. She says when something happens to us -- death, divorce, disease -- we are receiving a call to adventure. All bet\\'s are off. We must start fresh, gather our spirit guides, collect ourselves, dive into the underworld, overcome, and then emerge full of wisdom of growth.Griggs has emerged -- full of her own wisdom and growth.

I thought that I would be 40 years old when I went for my own mammogram and that I would casually learn that everything looked normal -- that breast cancer was of no concern. But it didn't happen this way -- instead I went for my first mammogram at age 34, six years earlier than recommended, because I felt an odd lump. And I learned that cancer was of concern. I learned that I had breast cancer. And so now, as I am about to turn 36, I have had three mammograms and will return every six months for the rest of my life for this test. By age 40, I'll be a pro.I once thought a family history of breast cancer trickled down from the older women in a family -- that a grandmother might have it first, then her daughter, then her daughter. Like a chain reaction. But now I know that family history can start with anyone, at any age. I started this chain in my family.&nbsp; And there is no telling whether or not the chain will break or will hold strong. So the women in my family are now followed almost as closely as I am. And mammograms occur frequently for us all. I was once unaffected by my mom's mammograms.&nbsp; Now I am more aware, more prepared for the seriousness of this exam, more humbled because of my own experience.

       " 'There is something to be said for the power of prayer. On the morning the lump in my breast was removed, a friend rallied more than 80 friends from our local MOMS Club to say a prayer for me -- at the exact time I was wheeled into an operating room. I know nothing of the prayer they said for me, but I do know I emerged from surgery with my breast intact and with the knowledge that my cancer had not spread to my lymph nodes. I don\\'t know for sure what role prayer played in my good fortune -- but I don\\'t discount that it is in some way responsible for the fact that I am alive today. But there are other obvious factors responsible for my survival -- like chemotherapy, radiation, physical therapy, targeted drug therapy, and counseling. So I don\\'t think prayer alone saved me. I think it took a balance of varied forces to save my life -- a balance one Ohio man was not able to achieve.The children of Darrell Perry are filing suit against their aunt, Darlene Bishop -- Perry\\'s sister and an evangelical preacher -- who claims both she and Perry were cured of cancer through prayer. Perry was not cured and died a year and a half ago from throat cancer. And Bishop now reveals she was never diagnosed with breast cancer -- like she claimed at one time -- but was merely worried she may have had the disease. Yet the message in her book Your Life Follows Your Words speaks loud and clear in its message -- that prayer can cure cancer.Perry\\'s children says their aunt is lying and exploiting their father for her own financial gain. They have filed two suits -- one accusing her of mismanaging and misusing Perry\\'s estate and the other alleging wrongful death for convincing Perry to pray rather than seek medical help. Comments: 1. I attend Solid Rock church and I just want you to know that the only liar is the Devil. When you have an abnormal, painful, bleeding lump in your breast you don\\'t need a doctor\\'s diagnosis to know what it is. That was the case of pastor Darlene\\'s. Of course she is going to keep pushing her brother to share in her faith that God will heal him because she experienced it. I went to a doctor and had brain surgery. The diagnosis was horrible when the doctor came out and told my wife. If she would have believed in the words he said instead of what the Bible says \" By His stripes we are healed\" I might not be here today getting ready to enjoy the birth of my second child that the fertility doctors said would be impossible to have. I lost my mom to cancer so i rejoice with those who beat it and I can feel the pain with those who don\\'t. Praise God for the fact miracles still exist 2. I knew Wayne Perry personally, he produced some songs for me in Nashville. I believe in healing but I also believe that the Lord put Doctors on the planet for our Greater Good. I have experienced healing myself, but it is all about us Learning to Listen For The Father\\'s Voice in Relationship(Prayer and Reading His Word) with him and then obeying what he says to do in each one of our different situations.I believe that if Wayne Perry would have been taught to \"Hear His Father\\'s Voice in His Situation\", then he would have done what was required of him to stay alive, if it was God\\'s Will. When Wayne came to his sister and asked her if he should take chemo, then she should have replied, \"What is the Father telling you to do\"? Even Jesus prayed as he sweat blood before he was Crucified, \"Please let this cup pass from me\" (this showed that he knew it would not pass, but his flesh wondered if it might pass from him),He obviously Heard His Father\\'s Voice when he finished with \"Not My Will But Thy Will Be Done\". That is how we need to pray, it does not show doubt for us to pray this way. So many times we are in huge churches and we as a congrgation are not taught to Hear the Voice Of Our Father for ourselves, we just think that God is in the Church and the Only one that hears him are the Pastors, but that is Not how God Works.He wants a Relationship with us one on one.I have had a total colon removal, hysterectomy, gall bladder removal and many other things happen to me before and after I became a Believer. I was a baby Christian then, Not Hearing the Father\\'s Voice, so I did not even ask him, because I did not know I needed to ask.I was personally allergic to over 100 things after the surgeries and have to still take some medications for it, but when I was first diagnosed I could only eat about 4 things in my diet. Over a Process of Praying and Listening to the Voice Of my Father in Heaven I now take 1/2 tablet of allergy meds a day instead of 4 a day, and I have added about 20 more things in my diet. I asked the Father, Do you want me to go off my medication? He said to me not until I tell you to. I asked him, can I eat this yet? He said not until I tell you. Then one day, he said to me, eat that, I asked him are you sure? He said you are healed of that. Then I ate it an was fine, and starting adding things into my diet as he directed me to.. Then one day when I was getting ready to take meds, he said don\\'t take that medication anymore so, I stopped taking it.It says in the Bible, If you eat vegetables, do not begrudge those who eat meat and like wise. I think we can apply that to many instances..I can see both sides though. I have compassion and love in my heart for Wayne\\'s Grown Children, I also understand that when a person is in \"The System\", they sometimes think they are teaching the right thing, when in fact they could be teaching the wrong thing because Our Father moves on each individual differently. One person may be miraculously healed and then another may have to take Chemo, but the person who is going through the trial, needs to listen to hear instruction from his or her Father in Heaven. Jesus said \"Repent and Be Healed\" throughout Scriptures, so, if we are not being healed, then we need to ask the Father why? Then we need to hear what he is telling us. He may be saying that we have issues (sin) inside that needs to be rooted out of us and then we will be healed.We as Ministers should be provoking others to \"Hear His Voice\" for Ourselves instead of trying to tell people what We THINK we are hearing him say. We will stand before the Throne about these things and have to become accountable for the misrepresentation of His Word.Sometimes we may not be hearing clearly ourselves exspecially if we are too close to the situation.3. I attended Solid Rock Church, but no longer do so. At one service Darlene Bishop and her husband Lawrence called people to the front for those who needed healing, laying of hands and prayers. What I got was a VERY HARD SLAP ON THE FACE !!!!! I was so extremely SHOCKED &amp; HURT !!! Words cannot describe it. To top that off, as I held my face with my hand, I saw a lady behind me laughing with glee at what she had just witnessed. I can only imagine the pain and grief the Perry children must be feeling....it\\'s nothing to the emotional pain I felt and experienced much less the physical pain.4. It is hard to believe that pastors can out right lie and you believe it. YOU can have a lump in your breast and it can bleed and it not be cancerous. Have you ever considered that something can drop in your chest and later it swells months later. This has happened to me. What about the time Darlene said she had chemo and her hair was falling out and that is why she wears a weave. Why are you defending lies?',\n",

       " 'Just before my radiation therapy began, my oncologist ran through a long list of potential side effects I might experience from the treatment. The only two significant short-term possibilities were fatigue and burned, blistered skin -- I went on to encounter them both -- but there were other more long-term effects my doctor told me might one day creep up on me. She told me the range of motion in my arm might be compromised -- it was -- and that lymphedema or swelling could occur -- not yet -- and that I could feel numbness and tingling in my arm -- I do -- and that I should forever take precautions on the left side of my body. No needle sticks, no blood pressure cuffs, no excessive lifting -- all because of radiation and the missing lymph nodes that further complicate matters.My doctor also told me that while radiation would target one intended area -- my left breast, just where my cancer was found -- other areas would suffer some degree of exposure. My heart, my lung, and my ribs all bordered the location of my tumor and despite measures to protect these areas, they would be zapped, at least minimally.This all seemed a bit overwhelming 18 months ago when it came barreling at me. But something fortunate happened with the passage of time -- I began to forget about most of this. And while this a blessing really -- to not be burdened by the what ifs -- I realized yesterday when my three-year-old son kicked me with all the force he could muster right in my ribcage that I really must remember the side effects of radiation -- because they could serve to haunt me at any moment.I remember clearly now my oncologist telling me that my ribcage could be damaged by radiation in such a way that an injury to the area could easily result in broken ribs. But I don\\'t think about this regularly. And I wasn\\'t thinking of it when I snuggled up to my 35-pound baby boy, knowing full well he could strike at any time. But not until he struck did I recall one of the downsides of radiation.I feel happy and healthy and strong. Like cancer never landed in my lap and threw me for a loop. But somewhere in the back of my chemo brain -- an entirely different side effect story -- I must remember the dangers of the treatments that are keeping me alive. Because the last thing I want is another complication from cancer. I just want smooth sailing -- and smooth snuggling. Comments: 1. The \"fallout\" from my radiation, some of it continuing years after the fact, has been the worst part of the whole cancer experience for me (next to the financial disaster because I was uninsured).

Participants responded to questions about diet, and their answers showed that as intake of certain foods went up, the risk of liver cancer went down. Factoring out other issues possibly contributing to this indication, researchers found that high intake of milk and yogurt cut the risk of developing liver cancer by 78 percent. High consumption of white meat lowered the risk by 56 percent, and when combined with high intake of fruit, this number dropped to 52 percent.These finding are particularly important for patients with hepatitis B and hepatitis C (HCV) infection. But overall, experts say anyone wishing to ward off liver cancer should adopt a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, limit alcohol consumption, and avoid HCV infection by practicing safe sex and never sharing needles.

Jacki, thanks for bringing us this news. I also saw it in our newspaper, so a lot of us should become aware of it.How does prayer make a difference? I\\'ve thought about that. I\\'m sure many of us have.For one thing, as you noted, it relieves stress and creates confidence, and research has linked reduced stress and higher confidence to better outcomes for diseases, including cancer. Even if we are wrong about the existence of God, those of us who pray are getting this benefit.Many believers also have a sense of an awesome power that influences their lives in ways that seem beyond the operation of nature as we understand it. I and some of my family and friends speak of instances where we feel God has touched our lives. The possibility of miracles is not strange to us. Just because our excellent science has not proved this power does not mean it does not exist. Think back to radio waves that have existed from time immemorial but were not detected and put to use until the development of the radio a little more than a century ago; the power was there, even though science did not yet recognize it.I have seen too many fine people succumb to cancer and other diseases to think that godly living and prayer are enough to reliably overcome the physical impact of cancer, and I have thought about how God interacts with us in disease. My own view is that there are some physical processes that are beyond spiritual intervention, at least most of the time, but there are other processes where the mind makes a difference. This mind-body connection is well established, whether sometimes God is involved or not. I believe that God will influence our disease outcomes (and our lives generally) where that is possible, and I believe it is more possible when we open ourselves to God, especially if we are supported by the prayers of others.It also seems to me that our suffering can serve a positive purpose, in our own lives and in the lives of others. I\\'m not into suffering and try to avoid it, but I\\'m convinced that suffering at times has a purpose, such as clarifying priorities and concerns in our own lives and motivating others. One of the authors who has written eloquently about this is Victor Frankl in his classic book \"Man\\'s Search for Meaning.\" Perhaps suffering is sometimes the answer to those of us who pray that God\\'s kingdom come, God\\'s will be done. My impression is that those of us who believe are generally also more comfortable with our fates than are those who do not believe, something that made a big difference for me when I was diagnosed with a challenging case of prostate cancer seven years (and a month) ago and given a prognosis of five years (including two declining years) by two respected doctors. (I\\'m doing a whole lot better than that!)What about all the medical tactics that believers like me willingly employ? That\\'s easy: we see that God may be involved in providing those tactics; I believe God is involved. It\\'s like the old story of the man facing a flood who would not leave his house, believing that God would save him. First the police came with a loud speaker in a car urging all to leave. But the man said he would stay and prayed to God. Second, the firemen came in a boat and called on the man to leave, but instead he stayed and prayed again for God\\'s help. Finally, the Army came in a helicopter and lowered a harness so the man could escape, but he refused, saying he knew God would help him, and again he prayed for deliverance. The next thing the man knew, he was being interviewed by a puzzled St. Peter, whowas surprized because the man was not supposed to die for many years. The man was also puzzled because God had not saved him. He asked St. Peter why, and St. Peter admitted he was at a loss. St. Peter said, You should be alive. When the flood came, first we sent a car to warn you, then we sent a boat to save you, and finally we sent that helicopter.\" Well, our doctors, medicines and other resources are like that car, boat and helicopter.I would like to read what others think about prayer and cancer.Jim2. Those who feel BETTER take the time to read support group messages and post to support groups. If one is not doing as well, one does not post as often. Thus, to say that those who used the words like prayer and worship had higher levels of overall well-being is true, not because the words had some health effect, but becuase those women who used them felt better and had the energy to contribute.It was also stated in the study that:Itâ\\x80\\x99s possible that religious talk in the sessions had some negative effects on patients, Shaw wrote in the study, published in the journal Psycho-Oncology. Previous research has found that some religious coping, such as a belief that one is being punished with illness by God, is associated with diminished mental health and quality of life.Some participants in Shaw\\'s study reported that they were so averse to the religious talk in the online sessions that they turned away from them. 3. I\\'ve always been told that there is medical evidence that people with an illness do better when they know that other people are praying for them, regardless of whether they, themselves, pray. Yet another reason to let people in our lives who are battling things like cancer know that we are thinking of them.4. Actually GS, the evidence indicates just the opposite:<A href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/04/060403133554.htm\" rel=nofollow>http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/04/060403133554.htm</A>5. Prayer does cure cancer but you have to understand how it works my wife has esopagel cancer and her cancer Dr and radiolgist both agree prayer is the only reason she can eat today the devil has throne every side effect of kemo at her and has beat every one prayer allows the Dr to make the right choices for treatment it allows the body to respond when it shouldn\\'t it gives the person strengh and hope when others will quit I have ben a wreck when my wife is calm and at peace only prayer and faith in GOD can do that ',\n",
       " \"I wrote earlier today about my mom -- about how she was headed for a mammogram this afternoon. She has since been for her exam, returned, and shared the news that we all wish for -- everything looks fine. Nothing suspicious. No cancer. And so that is my gift for today.I have received many gifts as a result of cancer -- the news of a clean and clear mammogram is just one such gift. There are many emotional gifts I've received since my breast cancer diagnosis a year and a half ago -- extra love, overwhelming support, loads of kindness, an abundance of prayers, recent compliments about my new dark, curly hair. And I've received many tangible gifts too that comfort me every day. When I walk into my kitchen, I see an angel made from a paper clip, a bead, and a ribbon -- it was a gift from my Chemo Angel once I graduated from my eight-week course in chemotherapy. When I walk into my bedroom, I see the quilt on my bed that was made by the loving hands of my mom friends and then delivered to my doorstep when I was sick, tired, and bald. I see a pink stuffed breast cancer bear sitting on my dresser and yellow, fuzzy, comfy socks inside my dresser drawer. I see a box of cards and letters and books and relaxation tapes -- and so much more -- that sits in another room. I wear a breast cancer charm bracelet that dangles from one arm and another that jingles from my other arm and a backpack that hangs from my back. I am surrounded by gifts that were priceless when they were given to me and are just as priceless today. These gifts that adorn my personal space lift my spirits, warm my soul, inspire me. They are constant reminders of where I've been and how far I've come. My gifts -- good news from a mammogram, emotional rewards, and actual tokens of the love and support that surround me -- have become a therapy I never looked for, never knew I'd discover, and never would trade for anything.

       " \"There are sometimes silver linings to the darkest of cancer clouds. I know -- because I have the dark cloud of HER2 positive breast cancer hanging over my head. HER2 positive means the tumor removed from my breast was aggressive. It aggressively over-expressed a protein that accelerates tumor growth. And it led to a poor prognosis -- that might be considered a good one too.You see, research on the whole HER2 issue is turning up some pretty powerful potions. Like Herceptin -- the drug that miraculously cuts recurrence upwards of 50 percent for positive women like me. I was a lucky recipient of this drug. And the pharmacist who mixed the drug for all 17 of my infusions tells me it's really a good thing I have this HER2 problem -- because the drugs created to attack the problem may just cure me of my disease.So in an odd turnabout -- from bad luck to good fortune -- I am not so sad my tumor was aggressive. It means there are bonus treatments for me. And if my cancer comes back and Herceptin no longer works, there is another drug called Tykerb. And now the Army is leading its own breast cancer vaccination study. The focus -- HER2.Early study results from Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. suggest a 50 percent reduction in disease recurrence for HER2 positive women who receive a vaccination of AE37.AE37 targets HER2 and boosts the body's immune system so it can battle the protein before it stimulates growth. It's similar to Herceptin, but the activity of AE37 stimulates a patient's own immune system to recognize the cancer target rather than interacting with the target directly.Should the Food and Drug Administration decide to support this study, it will proceed to Phase 3 testing, which includes a much larger pool of participants.

       " 'I once waited to see my oncologist -- in a room with nothing more than outdated magazines and my own wandering mind -- for four hours. I offered up 20 hours of my time for chemotherapy treatments and then spent five days -- two times, for a total of ten days -- waiting in the hospital for doctors to determine how to raise my blood counts and decrease my fever after the completion of a dose-dense chemotherapy attack. I traveled to and from radiation appointments for 35 days, spending an average of 90 minutes on each of these round-trip excursions. I reclined in an infusion chair every three weeks for 12 months so that a new breast cancer wonder drug could sail through my veins. I spent 52 hours in that chair. And I spent countless hours pouring out my emotions to a counselor, in an attempt to clear my mind of all that cancer took from me -- including my time.These are just seven memories I have of time lost to cancer. There are others -- countless others -- but this should suffice as proof that among all the potential side effects that accompany cancer, loss of time is a guarantee.According to the first study to put a price tag on the time patients spend battling cancer, it seems the disease steals at least $2.3 billion worth of time for patients in the first year of treatment alone.Eleven of the most common cancers were included in the study. And it was determined that 368 hours are lost during the first year of treatment for ovarian cancer. For lung cancer, 272 hours are lost. For kidney cancer, 193 hours go down the drain. These hours don\\'t take into account time spent in bed recovering from surgery or chemotherapy treatments. It accounts only for time engaged in actively receiving care -- it counts chemotherapy, radiation, blood tests, scans, surgery, check-ups, waiting to see doctors, and driving to and from appointments.The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, sheds new light on the burden of commitment -- the human cost of cancer.\"Cancer is more than the just the dollars and cents for the medicines and the treatments and the doctors. It\\'s also the lost opportunities for the patients,\" said the American Cancer Society\\'s Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, of this overlooked reality.Lichtenfeld says this study demonstrates the need for early detection. The earlier cancer is caught, the less time patients spend in the system. It also shows the need for more targeted therapies that spare patients physical side effects and allow them opportunities for taking pills at home instead of receiving treatment in clinics.I would love to have back the time I spent treating and recovering from cancer. But I\\'m not heartbroken over my lost time. Because it bought me something in the end -- more time. Comments: ',\n",

       " 'The ABC building in the Brisbane suburb of Toowong -- subject of a December 2006 post -- has been officially vacated following an investigation that turned up a cancer cluster among female employees. Over the past 11 years, 10 women from this one building have been diagnosed with breast cancer. Eight of the women worked in the ABC newsroom, and most had been there for more than five years. The breast cancer risk for these women was six times higher than for the general population of women in the area. And while the investigation continues and clues are beginning to connect, the big question -- Why? -- has still not been answered.It has been determined it is highly unlikely the increase in breast cancer was caused by exposure to radio frequency, low frequency electromagnetic radiation, or chemical contamination. According to experts, had any of these factors been at play, there would have been a rise in cancer among male employees as well as female employees. Therefore, it appears something specific to women has caused this cluster.Perhaps clues will emerge from an analysis of lifestyle influences -- like smoking, diet, and alcohol and medication use -- and already women have answered questions pertaining to body weight, height, level of physical activity, and reproductive history.One common theme among women is the use of oral contraceptives for periods varying from two to 18 years. Other interesting findings include the average number of babies born to the women -- 1.6 -- and the breastfeeding practices of the women -- each woman with a child breastfed for an average of 2.3 to 12 months -- and the educational background of the group -- of the 10 women, six have college degrees.Experts says these are important factors. Early puberty, late menopause, lack of breastfeeding, use of oral contraceptives, and the trend of older mothers having fewer babies all can influence breast cancer risk. And so can level of education. Research shows increased rates of breast cancer in women with white collar jobs -- which is related to socioeconomic status and late childbearing.Everything is important really -- because as breast cancer rates continue to skyrocket, all possible reasons need to be considered.One in eight women in Australia will be diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 85. About 13,261 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006. And it is predicted that 14,818 will be diagnosed in 2011.

       " \"The January 2007 issue of Reader's Digest is full of little tidbits of health news. Like how patients are losing patience with hospital emergency rooms.In an effort to cut the waiting time for ER patients -- the average wait time is three hours and 42 minutes -- some hospitals are offering incentives. One Ohio hospital is giving $25 gift cards to those made to wait longer than 30 minutes. Patients at three Virginia hospitals get a pair of movie tickets if they are not treated in 30 minutes, and a Nevada hospital is cutting fees for those who are not seen by a nurse within 15 minutes of arrival. The incentives appear to be working. One hospital cites a new wait average of 23 minutes and new patient satisfaction score of 90 percent.In other Reader's Digest news, it is reported that people who weigh themselves daily as part of a diet and fitness routine are more likely to regain lost pounds than those who avoid the scale. And in another news brief, information about the transnasal esophagoscopy (TNE) is shared. The TNE is an esophageal cancer screening procedure worth some attention. Few know about it's merits yet it may be a tool allowing earlier detection of a cancer often caught too late. It's a less risky procedure than tests requiring sedation, and the whole process is quite simiple. It merely involves numbing of the nose and insertion of an endoscope and tiny camera through the nostrils so pictures of the esophagus can be taken. This test is not recommended for symptom-free individuals -- just for those with a persistent cough or hoarseness, which are early signs of the disease.There's more where all this comes from -- hiding among the pages of this month's Reader's Digest.

       " \"I was driving down the highway today when I looked to my right and saw out of the corner of my eye a blue pick-up truck. The driver -- a man -- wore a cowboy hat and his passenger -- a woman -- wore a turban and a mask that covered her nose and mouth. It was similar to the yellow paper-like mask I wore during chemotherapy when low blood counts and fevers knocked my body all out of whack. So when I briefly glanced at this woman, I diagnosed her -- with cancer. I guess my medical radar could be off, my diagnosis could be wrong -- but I suspect not. It was an all-too-familiar sight -- the bald head obviously disguised, the mask warding off germs and infection, the eyes the only visible marking of a face. Yet it was still a startling sight, a sad sight, a sight that never loses its power over me as I travel the highway of life.I am thankful to still be on the highway -- to not have been tragically run off the road -- and the woman whose path I crossed today may be just fine after her journey with cancer runs its course. But it's such a dismal sight -- the ravages of cancer visibly displayed on the undeserving victims of a harsh disease. Maybe my approach is all wrong. Perhaps it would be better if my vision today prompted thoughts of a spirited warrior bravely battling a fierce opponent with victory the likely outcome. But instead I saw sickness and sadness. Because this is how I felt -- sick and sad -- when my appearance was marked by a hat and a mask.But now I am healthy and happy. And I am confident I will one day see my co-survivors in a more hopeful light. There is hope, after all, for each of us diagnosed with this life-threatening disease. Perhaps after I've been on the road to recovery for a while longer, dismal will turn to dazzle. Perhaps then I will see as much shine in those wearing cancer on their sleeves as I saw today in the blue paint of the truck that passed me on the highway. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'I\\'m not a big sports fan. But everyone in my family is, and I live in Gainesville, Florida -- home of the Florida Gators -- so by default, I\\'ve come to know a bit about sports. And I tend to get caught up in the orange and blue spirit that lives in this town. It\\'s contagious.I am thrilled that the Gator football team beat Ohio State Monday night, earning the 2007 National Championship title. But I am even more thrilled that one player -- safety Reggie Nelson -- gets to claim this victory, for himself and for his mother, who passed away on December 21 after a three-year battle with breast cancer.It must have been a bittersweet win for Nelson, who talked with his mom on the phone prior to each of his games. She was his biggest fan and one of his toughest coaches. She cheered him on and offered critiques all the same. But there was no phone call Monday night -- before Nelson\\'s biggest game ever. But his mom was surely present to witness the wonder and glory of her son. And Nelson surely made every move on that field in honor of her.\"My mom\\'s my life and my best friend,\" he said prior to her death. \"Everything I do is because of her. She\\'s always in my mind.\"Nelson did not speak to the media between the time of his mother\\'s death and his match-up with Ohio State. According to the BCS contract, all players must be made available to the media during media day. But the University of Florida struck an agreement with the BCS to waive the clause for Nelson so he could begin to heal from his loss, without the stress of the Arizona media frenzy.It\\'s been a difficult time for Nelson who is now speaking out about his mom.\"A person never gets over losing his mother,\" Nelson said on the field Monday night, as confetti fluttered on the national champs. \"I\\'m a Momma\\'s boy at heart. All I wanted was to make her proud.\"Previous posts about Reggie Nelson and his mom are as follows:Florida Gator Reggie Nelson loses mom to breast cancerFlorida Gator would trade football for family Comments: 1. I also witnessed Reggie Nelson\\'s heart warming comments after the underdog Gator\\'s triumphant blowout of the Buckeye\\'s in the BCS game. Anyone listening at the time surely was touched by his comments, knowing that during what is likely one of the most celebratory moments of this young man\\'s life, how bittersweet it also must have been for him. The unexpected domination in all areas of the game by UF definitely left many wondering how this team totally manhandled the fabled Ohio St team. After hearing the comments about his close relationship with his mom, I instantly wondered if there was perhaps assistance coming from above, compliments of a loving and proud mother admiring her son. Maybe she was letting her son know that she was still communicating with him that evening, just like any other game. Hopefully the joy of winning that night lent some healing to Reggie\\'s fresh wounds in his loss. A fellow SEC fan (University of South Carolina) here btw. 2.

       " 'Young women sometimes are dismissed when they pursue medical attention for suspicious lumps, bumps, pains, or changes in their breasts -- because breast cancer is not so common in young women and medical professionals may assume that breast cancer is not the culprit for the complaints brought before them by young women. But young women do get breast cancer -- I did at age 34 -- and many times, the tumors found in young breasts are more aggressive than those that appear for older women. So it is critical that young women seek medical attention for anything out-of-the-ordinary. And it is critical that doctors respond with urgency so that breast cancer in young women can be detected early -- and treated appropriately.Karen Mock did seek medical attention -- because she knew she had breast cancer. But four doctors told her that she was too young for this disease. She was in her early 30s. And by the time she found someone to respond to her concerns, her breast cancer tumor was 9.2 centimeters -- about the size of a grapefruit. The person Mock found was Dr. Judith Hurley at the Sylvester Cancer Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine who has spent the past 15 years trying to find the best treatment for women with large breast tumors. She offers great hope for women who may not get an early diagnosis or treatment -- minority women, poor women, and women with no health insurance -- and she has good results in patients with large tumors that have no spread to the lymph nodes or elsewhere in the body. Some patients have been cancer-free for four years after treatment -- which consists of chemotherapy to shrink the tumor, surgery, more chemotherapy, and then radiation. Mock is cancer-free today. When I entered the medical system after finding my own lump, I was not dismissed -- but I was assured by four doctors that what I felt was probably nothing. I was too young, they said. But they did move me along in the system -- to be cautious -- which revealed via mammogram, ultrasound, and biopsy that my tumor was in fact cancerous. It was caught early and had not spread -- thanks to prompt attention. Prompt attention is key so that tumors do not grow so large that they resemble grapefruits. But until young women are taken seriously and afforded the best medical attention, at least there are people like Dr. Hurley who can swoop in and make miracles happen. Comments: ',\n",

       " 'Cancer of the esophagus is one of the fastest rising cancers in the United States -- but the common screening test, both expensive and risky, is not widely used. Thankfully, a newer option, around since the mid-90s, is quicker and easier and is catching on around the country.Trans-Nasal Esophagoscopy (TNE) is the better option, and it works like this: a doctor numbs the nose, inserts a thin, flexible tube -- no bigger than a pencil -- through the nostril and into the esophagus, removes a bit of tissue for biopsy purposes, takes a few pictures, and pulls the tube back out through the nostril. The patient gets to watch it all on a monitor and gets to depart from the procedure with no ill effects.Traditional esophagus cancer screening involves a similar tube that is inserted through the mouth. Due to the gag reflex, patients are sedated. While there are often no complications from the procedure itself, the intravenous sedation can cause problems.\"You don\\'t need those risks to see what\\'s going on,\" says one doctor, who reports that esophageal cancer responds very well when caught early by tools like TNE.

       " \"Once upon a time there were two groups of mice, all genetically engineered to develop prostate cancer. Each group was fed the same amount of calories. One group of mice lived in cages warmed to 80.6 degrees. The other group lived in cages kept at 71.6 degrees. The mice in the cooler quarters burned more calories to keep warm. And after three weeks, they weighed less than the toasty warm mice. They were also less likely to develop prostate cancer.Then there were two other groups of mice, also genetically engineered to develop prostate cancer. Both groups were kept in cages with temperatures 80.6 degrees and 71.6 degrees -- like above. But these mice got to eat whatever their little hearts desired. The mice in cooler cages ate 30 percent more than the mice in warmer cages. They got just as fat as the warm mice. And they all got prostate cancer at the same rate, despite the extra calories.The moral of the story is this -- being lean rather than obese has a greater protective effect against cancer. Excess calorie retention, rather than consumption, raises cancer risk. This moral stands in contrast to what most researchers believe -- that a restricted diet cuts the risk of and slows the growth of cancer and this is directly related to calorie intake.Tim Nagy, Ph.D. and professor of nutrition sciences at the University of Alabama, Birmingham and lead researcher on the mice story says when you eat more calories than you burn, you store the extra calories as fat. It's the fat cells -- not the extra calories themselves -- that affect cancer risk.It's not a good idea for humans to chill themselves to avoid cancer, Nagy says. But perhaps people could get the same effect by exercising more since that, too, burns calories.Nagy's study appears in the January 1 issue of the journal Cancer Research. Comments: \",\n",

       " \"In a radical new approach to attacking cancer, researchers will soon attempt to kill tumors by infecting them with viruses that cause ailments like the common cold. This virus therapy treatment -- considered the third pillar alongside chemotherapy and radiation -- could one day become standard battle against cancer.One Belfast doctor says anything that could improve the lives of cancer patients is worth a try. And try is exactly what Leonard Seymour, Professor of Gene Therapy at Oxford University, plans to do when he begins leading trials later this year.Seymour, who has been working with viruses that kill cancer cells while sparing healthy tissue, will use a stealth virus masked from the body's immune system with a polymer coat that could travel through the bloodstream and reach tumors. Two viruses are likely candidates for study in the first clinical trials -- adenovirus, cause of a cold-like virus, and vaccinia, cause of cowpox and a component in the smallpox vaccine.Preliminary research on mice shows that virus therapy works well on tumors resistant to standard cancer drugs. But several years of trials will be necessary before the therapy can be considered for use on all cancers. Comments: \",\n",

       " 'Lance Armstrong, champion of both cycling and cancer, wrote a commentary recently for CNN. His message was loud and clear -- he is losing patience with Washington politicians set on cutting funds for cancer research -- and while his words have not yet spurred positive change for cancer initiatives, they have inspired cancer survivors from all over the world who are responding with their own commentaries on sickness and survival. The outpouring of sentiment inspired by Armstrong\\'s commentary is overwhelming. Today, I offer just a glimpse into what survivors -- seven of them -- are expressing in the spirited e-mails they are sending to CNN. Jerry Kelly of Birmingham, AlabamaMy dad died of cancer 10 years ago, almost the same time Lance was diagnosed and subsequently founded the Lance Armstrong Foundation. My wife and I met Lance a few years later after I was diagnosed and we went to Austin for the LAF Ride for the Roses (fundraising bike ride). Lance\\'s story had been very inspirational when I found it just minutes after my diagnosis with testicular cancer. What we didn\\'t realize was how much inspiration we would get from other survivors and caregivers as we shared stories. Lance also spoke of something his doctor told him about, the Obligation of the Cured. The important thing to remember is that we can all make a difference if we are willing to give the effort. You don\\'t have to win the Tour de France to join the LiveStrong Army!Brian D. of Austin, TexasThe costs of this disease even for folks that have good insurance are well beyond reach. Depending on when you discover the cancer and what type of cancer you have, the out-of-pocket costs are far beyond the average person\\'s ability to pay. This is of course assuming that you want to extend your quality of life and you want access to the latest advancements in cancer treatment. We are called society\\'s \"catastrophic cases.\" I am a 4Â½-year survivor of primary brain cancer. The technical name for my disease is anaplastic astrocytoma grade III. It is basically a slow-growing glioblastoma multiforme -- a death sentence. But I am young and up to the challenge. I am a card-carrying member of the LAF organization. I think what Lance is doing is great ... I think this article is great and I think our Congress should give more tax credits to those of us trying to live a normal life. Shame on them for not acting!Anne Hawkins of Douglasville, GeorgiaI was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 36. I am now 42Â½ and I have been diagnosed with breast cancer again -- a different type than the first time. I caught it in time thanks to my diligence in screening. However I am going through chemo for a second time in my life since it was an aggressive cancer and I\\'m so young. I am appalled that none of our politicians consider this a running topic! And the funding has been cut? That\\'s unbelievable.Marianna Costa, Melbourne, AustraliaWhile I am writing from Australia, unfortunately the experiences of others sound all too familiar in our world. My wonderful father died in 2005 from cancer. The devastation to lives infested by cancer could never be measured in dollars. My conclusion is that cancer treatment is a global business. While I have faith in people of science to rid us from this world catastrophe, there is a global lack of resolve in governments, the corporate sector and medical institutions.Casey Cronin of Austin, TexasI\\'m 19 years old and I was diagnosed with cancer on December 3. I had my first surgery on December 7 and the second surgery on December 22. The pain I experienced was beyond belief. I had to accept the fact that I had cancer, go through with these surgeries, and sit in a hospital on Christmas. The second surgery was to remove my lymph nodes on my back and the nodes came back negative. Without cancer research I might not have been so lucky. I\\'m outraged that Congress has cut funding towards cancer research but continue to spend an arm and a leg on defense spending. I have a friend with Hodgkins lymphoma and unfortunately he doesn\\'t have insurance. He\\'s 23 and scraping by trying to make sure he might live past his 30s. Cancer is real threat to our health.Betty Hoffmeister of Taylorville, IllinoisA year ago, October 2005, my daughter was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer of colon and liver. Not given much hope, but she is a fighter and a real sweet person. She takes chemo every other week on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and then is so sick she has to stay in bed for a day or two. But then she gets up and does what ever her little body will let her do. They just say keep doing what you are doing, but we are really worried. I would like for her to hear some real encouraging news soon before she loses the will to keep fighting. God is very good.

We succeeded in helping elect a congress that should be more sympathetic to adequate cancer funding. I am not sympathetic to Democratic Party leadership that has said it will just coast along on a continuing resolution that provides a continuation of the same level of funding from last year for this year. They argue it is too difficult to pass a new budget at this time. I don\\'t believe that! Now we must get the Democratic Party leadership in Congress to fulfill the promises made before the election by so many Democratic office holders (and many Republicans too). I have already contacted my senators and representative and plan to follow-up.This is frustrating, but our cause is sound and numbers are on our side.Jim Waldenfels',\n",

       " 'It\\'s been reported that procrastination is on the rise. Not only that, but it makes people poorer, fatter, and unhappier too.It took 10 years of research when it was projected to take only five years -- procrastination at its best -- to come to this conclusion. And now Canadian industrial psychologist and University of Calgary professor Piers Steel is talking about his giant 30-page study that appears in this month\\'s Psychological Bulletin.Something must be done about this problem, says Steel, who reveals 26 percent of the American public consider themselves chronic procrastinators. This is up from five percent in 1978 and is likely due to the tempting diversions facing us in this day and age -- TVs, cell phones, video games, iPods, the Internet, and Blackberries.It\\'s no surprise with such temptations that a quarter of Americans say they procrastinate. When it comes to the sexes, men are worse than women -- about 54 out of 100 chronic procrastinators are men -- and the young are more like to procrastinate than the old. Three out of four college students consider themselves procrastinators. And it seems perfectionists procrastinate less because they don\\'t like to delay.Steel says procrastination wastes time. And it\\'s costly too.\"The U.S. gross national product would probably rise by $50 billion if the icon and sound that notifies people of new e-mail suddenly disappear,\" he said. Steel found a delay in filing taxes on average costs a person $400 a year. Last-minute Christmas shopping with credit cards was five times higher in 1999 than in 1991. Clearly, procrastination is expensive.Procrastination also has physical and emotional costs. Procrastinators tend to be less healthy, less wealthy, and less happy. They are also harder to heal of their problems than alcoholics.Steel, who plans to one day compare the procrastination practices in various countries and cultures, says his field has benefits. The more he knows about the problem, the less he indulges in delay tactics. He did, however, acknowledge that his study was completed five years late. But what he likes about this study is this -- \"If you take a day off from it, you can always say it\\'s field research.\"           Comments: <SPAN id=byLine></SPAN>1.

I read the article online and cataloged the gist of the story in my head. But I didn't do much with the information as I was in the midst of treatment for breast cancer and thought perhaps at a later date, I could better sort through the abundance of resources that were sent my way.So now I am sorting through all kinds of cancer-related material that fills a large box in my house. And I came across a note I had made about this program -- which is really pretty enlightening now that I have the mindset to really appreciate it.Buddy Check 12 is a breast self-exam awareness program started by Jeannie Blaylock of Jacksonville, Florida just after her friend, at the age of 29, died of breast cancer. Jeannie partnered with Baptist Medical Center and has sent more than 500,000 kits to women across the county -- with pamphlets about breast cancer and stickers for calendars to mark the 12th of each month.Women are encouraged to conduct a self-exam on the 12th of each month and to then call and remind a buddy to do the same. If women and their buddies are consistent about their self-exams at the same time each month, they are more likely to detect a change in their breasts and can then pursue medical attention. Early detection can save lives -- and early detection often results from a woman's own exam of her own breasts.Jeannie Blaylock lost her friend whose breast cancer was not detected early enough. Jeannie felt anger at first and then realized she had the power to change her future. And she is changing the future for all women who take part in this program -- women whose lives can be saved by early detection. Comments: \",\n",

       " 'New research indicates when women and men have lung cancer of the same stage and receive the same treatment, women are more likely to survive.Several studies extracting data from national cancer registries have shown that lung cancer survival is different for men and women. This study, published in the journal Chest, is the first to compare the sexes when staging and treatment are identical. It took seven years to follow 1,085 patients with non-small cell lung cancer -- the most common type of the disease -- and at five years, 60 percent of women were still alive compared with 50 percent of men. Overall, female survival rates were consistently higher for all stages of the disease. Researchers, who ensured there were no differences between the sexes in terms of race, other diseases, smoking history, lung function, and treatment, are not exactly sure why women fare better. But they speculate that women might respond better to chemotherapy.What researchers do know for sure, however, is that these findings -- if given a chance -- could help improve the overall five-year survival rate for patients with non-small lung cancer by helping to locate new therapeutic options.

I slammed my little toe -- hard -- and I'm pretty sure it's broken. It's red and swollen. It hurts and throbs. It barely fits in a shoe. And the pedicure I got the other day -- a not-so-wise choice, I know -- really caused my baby toe a lot of discomfort. Yesterday, while wearing cute little sandals -- to show off my french pedicure, of course -- I followed my husband and two little boys on an outdoor adventure down a steep cliff. Our destination was a stream -- the boys love water -- and while I didn't tumble and fall down the hill, I did gain a lot of momentum on my descent and ended up running full force toward the stream -- directly into a boulder of a rock, where my other little baby toe scraped right across a jagged edge. A chunk of skin hung off my toe, blood seeped out, and I hopped around on my other foot -- with its own possibly broken toe -- while the pain eased up a bit. And then I sat down and contemplated my recent toe misfortune.My injured toes, along with an itchy, irritating skin rash I suspect is due to an allergy of some sort, have caused me some amount of stress. But it's not major, it's not debilitating, and it's doesn't even compare to the stress of cancer. I keep playing this cancer comparison over in my head -- minor pain vs. major pain, minor stress vs. major stress. Others in my life are doing the same. My fitness trainer, who has been on crutches for weeks and weeks with a broken foot, told me when she feels down about her condition, she reminds herself, it's not cancer.Life has become a matter of perspective for me like never before. Cancer set the bar. And now all other life issues go up against this bar -- and any that are not a matter of life and death I realize are just not so bad.So I have two sore toes. And itchy skin.

It also puts patients at high risk for recurrence, marked by a very short time between treatment and relapse.\"Ideally, a marker like nestin would enable clinicians to monitor these patients through frequent tests of a biomarker and, in doing so, detect the cancer before it has a chance to come back,\" says one professor.Researchers must now find an effective means of detecting nestin in a clinical screening setting.

But the intensive treatment rendered his left lung useless and then a blood clot appeared in his right lung, prompting his admission to the hospital where he spent his remaining days in an induced coma.Parsons was confident he could survive with one lung and compared his condition to that of John Wayne.\"John Wayne lived and had a great career with one lung,\" he said. \"There is no reason why I can\\'t do the same. It will take a little while for the right lung to pull the weight for the left lung so until then I will still need to use oxygen when I walk. I won\\'t need it sitting or commentating races and to me that is the main thing. If given a choice between cancer or losing a lung I would say that I got the right end of the deal.\"Parson\\'s intense spirit was his trademark. It motivated him to rise from a poor childhood, leave behind a taxi driving job, and head straight to the top of NASCAR. His success is marked by his 1994 induction into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame and his 1995 induction into the National Motorsports Press Association\\'s Stock Car Racing Hall of Fame. One of NASCAR\\'s 50 greatest drivers and the 1973 champion, Parsons retired from racing in 1988 and headed straight into a broadcasting career. He spent the past six years as a commentator for NBC and TNT and even continued to call races from the booth during his treatment. He hosted a weekly radio program and kept fans updated on his condition on his very own blog.Judging by the comments left for Parsons on a January 8th post about his hospitalization, there was an abundance of love for this man, nicknamed BP by the NASCAR community.\"He was a great driver and a terrific broadcaster, but above anything else he was a kind and generous human being,\" said Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports. \"His character and spirit will define how he is remembered by all of us.

       " 'Canadian researchers have made an unexpected discovery in a molecule that appears to drastically boost the ability of standard drugs to kill breast cancer cells. Currently, the discovery has been confined to the lab -- but researchers hope the power of this molecule, the ANK peptide, can one day be used to counter drug resistance for many women with breast cancer.Scientists from Queen\\'s University say the ANK peptide, not a drug by itself, gives drugs like taxol and nocodazole more than triple the ability to kill breast cancer cells. One scientist says the process of enhancing drug effectiveness is much like adding flavor to coffee to make it taste better. This is exciting news, but the results -- published Monday in the journal Cancer Research -- only apply to lab experiments at this point. Researchers must now proceed with testing the peptide-drug combination in lab mice. If successful, they will move on to human testing. The whole process could take years. But early results are so promising that application for a U.S. patent on the peptide has already been made.According the medical experts, breast cancer patients can become resistant to some drugs depending on duration of treatment, dose of medication, and genetic makeup.\"This peptide would be able to give them another chance,\" said a researcher from this study. \"For those who respond reasonably well, they will do even better; for those who don\\'t respond to this drug treatment ... we greatly hope this will make the current drug more useful by extending its impact to a wider range of people, particularly those with a resistance problem.\" Comments: ',\n",

Previous abdominal discomfort, much like dull menstrual pain, preceded Tanya\\'s screening but she was sure it was due to menopause. She was 53 at the time.But it wasn\\'t menopause. It was cancer. And it was devastating for Tanya who was spared radical surgery in exchange for a combination of radiation and a chemotherapy called the Nigro Protocol. First came a mitomycin push followed by four to five days of 5-Fluorouracil. Radiation came next -- for six weeks -- and then Tanya endured another round of the same chemotherapy regimen.\"The treatment was brutal,\" Tanya says. \"By the end of the sixth week, I was in a lot of pain, especially since the affected area had a lot of traffic and could not exactly be decommissioned and allowed to heal.\" Although she was told by her oncologist she tolerated her treatment well, Tanya says it was pure hell.Tanya\\'s treatment ended in March and an August biopsy revealed she is doing just fine. Her cancer appears to be gone. What is not gone, however, is the discomfort that still plagues her -- both physically and emotionally. And while the physical scars are simply terrible -- she feels pain during urination and bowel movements and is currently unable to have intercourse with her knight-in-shining-armor husband -- the emotional isolation is overwhelming distressing.\"I have not shared this experience with too many people since I feel awkward discussing that part of my anatomy and because the condition is so uncommon,\" Tanya says. \"I would, however, be most grateful to discuss any or all of this with someone who has been through the same experience.\"If you have been in Tanya\\'s same cancer boat, have paddled similar waters, or know someone with whom she might connect, please consider contacting this brave survivor at sultana@cyberight.net.

He can build an entire city with toy blocks and crafty cabins with the same Lincoln Logs his daddy used more than 30 years ago. Most recently, Joey has been sharpening his skills with Lego.Today, while his daddy built him a Lego jet, Joey constructed his own masterpiece. He called it his Cancer Center. I wasn't around to hear Joey dedicate his building to such an important cause. But I heard about it after the fact when Joey offered me a mini-tour of the structure. I learned that the center has a helicopter landing pad and offices with windows for the employees. I was shown an emergency vehicle with its own system for taking blood from patients, rendering it healthy, and then returning it to the body. And then just as I wanted more -- more details, more specifics, more history on just why he built this cancer center -- Joey's attention moved elsewhere. And so I know nothing more about the cancer center sitting in the playroom of my house.Cancer is no strange topic for Joey who has been along on my own cancer ride for the past two years -- so perhaps I am the inspiration for his architectural creation. But I suspect the real driving force behind Joey's latest project is the vacant land we passed yesterday. This land is the future site of a new cancer center in our city, and Joey probably heard me talking about the ground breaking ceremony that just took place. Regardless, cancer was on his mind this morning. And while the topic may be far from his mind now -- and I'm sure the building will be demolished by the day's end -- I am touched that for mere moments, Joey was invested in a noble cancer endeavor.

Finally, after 35 years, it seems we are winning the war.Experts say the absolute decline in cancer deaths is quite amazing -- because our population is both growing and aging, both of which could contribute to an increased cancer death rate. But prevention, early detection, and early treatment are working wonders and are saving lives for three of the most common cancers -- breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. More and more men are also surviving lung cancer due to cessation of smoking more than 20 years ago. The female lung cancer death rate is not declining, however, due to continued high rates of smoking.The highest drop in deaths among the major cancers was for colorectal cancer -- thanks to effective screening methods. Deaths dropped by 1,110 for men and 1,094 for women.According to an American Cancer Society review of U.S. death certificates, cancer deaths declined by 369 between the years 2002 and 2003. Between 2003 to 2004, the decrease was 3,014 -- more than eight times greater.

Additionally, those with a history of gum disease and recent tooth loss have a 2.7-fold increase in risk.Previous studies have linked gum disease and pancreatic cancer, but smoking -- which contributes to both diseases -- has never been taken into consideration. Researchers in this study, who controlled for smoking, followed 51,529 men for 16 years and found those who reported gum disease were 64 percent more likely to have pancreatic cancer. Nonsmokers with gum disease were twice as likely to develop the disease.It was also determined in the study, published in the January 17 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, that the more severe the gum disease, the higher the cancer risk.While it is not clear why gum disease is linked to cancer risk, researchers believe perhaps long-term gum infections trigger body-wide inflammation -- and inflamed tissues send chemical signals that promote tumor growth.

       " \"Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. So any bit of progress on the pancreatic cancer front is a big deal. And researchers are happy to report they've found a chemotherapy drug that can help patients who have received surgery prevent a return of the disease for a longer period of time.In a German study, participants who received Gemzar, or gemcitabine, lived an average of 13.4 months without their cancers coming back. Participants who did not receive the drug lived without the disease for 6.9 months. While the findings of this study may seem modest, they really are quite encouraging because pancreatic cancer is such a rapid killer, and patients with this disease have the worst chances of recovery.This study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association, brings hope for the mere 20 percent of pancreatic cancer patients who are candidates for surgery. While surgery is the best hope for a cure, the disease still returns in the majority of cases -- so Gemzar is surely worth a shot.It should be noted that some study authors report financial ties to Gemzar drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co.

       " 'I have dense breasts. And ever since the surgeon who performed my breast reduction surgery more than 10 years ago told me about the composition of my breast tissue, I have been a bit obsessed with how my breasts feel. Good thing -- because I ended up with breast cancer two years ago as a result of my own at-home monitoring. And now I wonder if my cancer was influenced by the density characterizing the tissue that fills my breasts.Canadian researchers are reporting in a groundbreaking study that women with dense breasts, like me, are five times more likely to develop breast cancer than whose whose breasts have a lot of fatty tissue. It\\'s long been knows that dense breasts inhibit the effectiveness of X-ray mammograms -- and perhaps delay diagnosis -- but now it\\'s clear that breast density is a risk factor all on its own. \"Breast density is an \\'extremely important\\' factor that accounts for up to one-third of all cases,\" says lead investigator Norman Boyd of the Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto Dr. Boyd says breast size has no bearing on density, and women cannot determine their degree of density on their own.Density is the percentage of breast tissue not clearly visible on X-ray mammography. While fat shows up dark on mammograms, dense tissue appears light -- making it difficult to spot tumors.This is not all bad news, say the authors of the study who report that density decreases with age. This research opens up a whole new avenue of prevention because the factors that affect density -- hormones, diet, exercise, environmental exposures -- can hopefully be altered. Also, this is very important news for women because it provides them with new and better information. And now, women who know they have dense breasts can insist on more frequent screening. This research is published in Thursday\\'s edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.

       " 'Health care provider Dr. Anthony Vendryes wrote Monday in the Jamaica Gleaner that he is distressed at the growing number of young women developing cancer -- especially breast cancer. He believes women are not working very hard at preventing the disease. He thinks we are just waiting for the problem to surface and then treating it with \"painful and often ineffective\" efforts.According to Vendryes, research indicates a woman\\'s risk of developing breast cancer is under her own control. If we live a lifestyle that promotes cancer, we are apparently likely to get the disease. Such a lifestyle would include gaining more than 11 pounds after the age of 18, exercising less than one time per week, eating less than five servings of fruits and vegetables per day, eating more than three ounces of red meat per day, ingesting too much fat and salt, consuming more than one alcoholic drink per day, and smoking cigarettes.I am all for healthy living. And I believe achieving good health is under our control. I would personally recommend every woman take charge of her life in a healthful manner. But I do not believe as Vendryes states, \"most women actually give themselves cancer by making poor choices in life.\" I think it\\'s the word most that bothers me.Obviously, there is a connection between lifestyle choices and chronic disease. And of course our level of health is under our control -- to some extent. But I don\\'t believe it\\'s fair to claim most women ask for breast cancer. I know I didn\\'t.I did not choose cancer. It chose me. Vendryes might say I am one of the disillusioned people who think cancer is entirely a matter of chance or entirely a matter of genetics. Actually, I suspect it\\'s a combination of all factors. All I know for sure, however, is that my own lifestyle choices were pretty darn healthy prior to my diagnosis. My weight has always been in a normal range -- and while I did gain more than 11 pounds twice in my life, it was due both times to the more-than-ten-pound babies I delivered into the world. I have always eaten a fairly healthy diet. I consume sweets, salt, and fats in moderation. I have never smoked and have consumed alcohol only minimally. And I have always consistently exercised. I admit I have eaten red meat, although never daily. And I\\'m sure I fall short on the recommended intake of fruits and vegetables. But really, I cannot even begin to imagine that my lifestyle was an invitation for cancer. And it makes me sad that most other young women, shocked by a diagnosis of breast cancer like me, might think they asked for such a horrible disease.It\\'s been two years since my breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent \"painful and often ineffective\" treatments. And although I have made some lifestyle changes -- I never drink alcohol now, I exercise a little more, and I don\\'t choose to eat red meat if other options are available -- my life is much the same as it was prior to cancer. And I am certain that if cancer makes a return visit to my body, it will not be because I asked for it. Comments: 1. Interesting article on cancer. Hope to see more of your postings.',\n",
       " 'The American Cancer Society has happily announced that cancer deaths have declined for the second straight year. This is big news -- mostly because our population is growing and aging and it\\'s entirely possible this could have led to an increase in cancer deaths. Not only is this not true, but the drop in deaths for this second year is eight times greater than the drop during the first year. Amazing.It\\'s hard to imagine in light of this great news that there are still less hopeful statistics out there on the cancer front. But there are so many dimensions to this disease -- prevention, detection, diagnosis, treatment, survival -- that the numbers can vary tremendously depending on perspective.From the perspective of diagnosis, one in two men and one in three women in America today will develop cancer during their lifetimes. These staggering statistics, based on data collected during 2001 through 2003, are detailed in a pivotal paper appearing in The Oncologist -- a monthly peer-reviewed journal for doctors devoted to cancer patient care.Dr. Matthew Hayat and colleagues, who worked on this paper for the National Cancer Institute, reveal other worrisome numbers and facts. It seems the number of new cancer patients is expected to more than double from the current 1.36 million in 2000 to almost 3 million in 2050. Five-year survival for all cancer stages combined ranges from as low as 16 percent for lung cancer patients to 100 percent for prostate cancer patients. And black Americans are reported to have the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates for men and women for all cancers combined.So while less people are dying from cancer, diagnosis of the disease seems to be on the rise. Not exactly a perfect scenario -- but if science and research can keep up, perhaps those diagnosed with cancer will need to prepare not for death, but for the management of a chronic condition.

The news of cancer deaths dropping is great, but the reality is we need to focus on doing more early on in our kids lives to really see a sharp decline. We need to focus on educating our kids about cancer, early detection methods, obstacles survivors face and the practical realities of cancer diagnosis. On CNN\\'s special \"Saving Your Life\" they mentioned we cannot sit back an wait for a cure. We already know we can prevent 33% of all cancer related deaths if they were caught early. The only way to do this is through education, face to face, not by handouts. We need to go to schools, colleges and other outlets to start the education.Can you imagine! We could save over 200,000 lives! LIVESTRONG!3. I wonder how insurance status impacts these figures: how much higher is the mortality rate among uninsured people? With the middle class being squeezed out, how do socioeconomic factors affect the statistics? And Jason, my prayers are with you and your friend.Regards,Richard Day Gore4. I firmly believe that we are discovering cancer more than ever before due to routine screening and early detection. As early as 20 years ago many cancers went undiagnosed or were diagnosed too late into the disease process to elicit a remission let a lone a cure. The fact that we are diagnosing more cancer yet have experienced a drop in cancer mortalities is a testament to this fact. To what do we attibute cause? The wave of health preventative initiatives have resulted in greater awareness of cancer risks and the necessity of early screening. Sometimes we have to look beyond the numbers to understand their true meanings.',\n",

The sensors will also determine whether or not tumors are growing. Cancer specialists have long wished for better methods of measuring the success of drugs. While blood tests can show if a drug has reached the bloodstream, they don't reveal much about the tumor itself.

Their goal is to one day make the implant as thin as the pieces of led used in mechanical pencils.This research, funded by the National Cancer Institute, is part of a long-term project to make medical technologies that will cure cancer.

She responds to questions about make-up, skin care, hair care, and overall body care too. In her February 2007 column, Val writes, \"Many of you have written to tell me that you began to be less critical of your body when you appreciated the things it could do.\" As I read this, I had what Oprah would call an Aha! moment, a moment when something just clicks and makes sudden sense. Aha!, I thought, as I considered all the things my body can do, completely independent of how I look on the outside. So while I was jogging today -- my body can now easily run three miles -- I ran through all of my body\\'s accomplishments, and I stored them in the files of my mind so I could later write them down. Here are seven things my body can do. As you read them, consider your own body -- its strength, its power, its capacity for greatness -- and remind yourself of your wondrous self the next time you start to criticize the way you look.   My body can partner in the creation of human life. It can carry babies and   deliver them and love them and care for them and raise them. Not all bodies   have this power. I am lucky.   My body can climb an attic staircase, crawl into cramped and dark corners,   pull large boxes out of wedged spaces, drag them back to the staircase, and   walk backwards down the stairs with goods balancing on my head so that I can   fulfill the wish my five-year-old child who wanted so badly in early November   to assemble our Christmas tree and decorate our house for the holidays. \"Let\\'s   wait until Daddy gets home,\" I told Joey when I found myself crammed into a   tiny space in the attic, wrestling with a heavy box full of artificial tree   parts. \"You can do it, Mommy,\" Joey said. \"You are strong.\" And so I fought my   way through the frustrating feat because I was afraid of the lessons I would   teach this little boy if I didn\\'t. In the end, it was Joey who taught me the   lesson. I can do it. I am strong.   My body can endure and conquer a 5K run when it once could barely run   around the block. With a little extra effort and push, I think my body can   accomplish even more.   My body, once weak and without definition, can lift increasingly heavy   weight and can generate muscle tone. It can even do push-ups -- real push-ups.   It takes dedication and practice and persistence and mental toughness too. But   I see progress. I feel progress. And I want more.   My body can help others. I can use my fingers to type words on a keyboard   that will reach friends and family and people I don\\'t even know. My words can   inform and support and encourage and heal. I can use my hands and my   semi-creative talents to create hand-made gifts, to cook and deliver very   mediocre meals for friends in need, to massage my husband\\'s sore back, to   braid my niece\\'s beautiful hair and paint her tiny nails. I can use my arms to   hug my little boys with all my might. I can use my voice to communicate, my   ears to listen, my senses to feel.   My body can tolerate surgery and chemotherapy and radiation and horrible   allergic reactions to antibiotics. My body was badly beaten by a treatment   protocol intended to cure me of a disastrous disease. And somehow, in some   way, it survived.   My body killed cancer. With the aid of medical intervention and a hopeful   attitude, my body overcame the worst and best thing that has ever happened to   me. And if it could do nothing else, I would be truly happy for this one thing   my body can do. Comments: 1.

And here are just seven simple but everlasting gifts to consider sharing with dad on this Father's Day.Roses are Red, Violets are BlueConsider writing a poem for dad -- just a few lines to let him know you admire him, to capture a fond memory, or to reveal your appreciation for all he has done for you. Drop it in the mailbox, send it through e-mail, or call dad and read it aloud. Your words might just warm his heart, lift his spirits, and bring a smile to his face.&nbsp; And a copy of the poem can be saved and treasured forever. Adults can help kids write their own personalized poems -- which can be embellished with scribbles and drawings. Be sure to date the poem so dad can look back and recall the specific day you shared your prose with him.I love my dad because . . . Write down a few phrases with dad in mind and then complete your thoughts -- I love my dad because . . .&nbsp; or my dad's greatest accomplishment is . . . or my dad has taught me . . . Like with the poem, find the best method for getting this gift to dad so he can cherish it for years to come. Adults -- you can help your kids do this too. A walk in the park If you live close to dad, invite him for a walk -- in a park, in your neighborhood, in a place where nature can calm and soothe you both. While strolling, chat about life with dad -- and find a moment to let him know how you feel about him. Recall childhood memories, recent memories, plans for future time spent together. Soak up the beauty of the outdoors, breathe the air, and let all worries wash away as you enjoy this slice of life with dad. Adults can organize a family walk for dad and kids and can help focus the conversation.Project togethernessPlan and execute a project with dad -- adults can help kids get started -- that allows for time spent in a productive manner. Teamwork, communication, physical activity, and a sense of accomplishment can all result from this labor of love. Build a birdhouse, perhaps, and then hang it in the yard and watch how this gift benefits not only you and dad -- but nature too.Time began in a gardenHow about planting a garden -- small, medium or large -- with the intention of bonding with dad and starting a healthy eating regimen too. Plant fruits and vegetables, tend to their development, watch them grow, and then reap the benefits of eating from the earth. You might start a flower garden too and watch the progress of colorful blooms that can brighten your days.A blockbuster extravaganzaFor indoor fun, honor dad with a movie night -- complete with his favorite flicks and his favorite healthy snacks. Join him for the event -- or from a distance, provide the means to make this time for a little rest and relaxation happen. Tell dad the night is all about him. You, dad, and a starry nightWith your backs on the grass and your eyes pointed toward space, delight in the wonder of the nighttime sky by watching the stars with dad. Talk about what you see, wish upon some stars, discuss your hopes and dreams, and let your bodies rest and refresh as the stars twinkle from above. If you and dad can't do this together, you can both find a spot in the grass and chat on the phone while you both look at the same sky from different locations.My husband is enjoying his Father's Day gift right now. He and our oldest child -- Joey, age five -- are at the beach where they are playing in the sand, jumping in the waves, and catching fish. A wrapped gift would have done the trick -- and has been our staple for most of the past five years -- but a little quality time, a little physical activity, and a little mental peace make for a Father's Day I know both father and son will never forget.

       " 'A clinical study involving 1,000 prostate cancer patients was stopped this week by Southwest Oncology Group in Michigan due to concerns the treatment may have caused leukemia in three of the participants.The men in the study received the chemotherapy drug mitoxantrone, thought to possibly improve survival rates for those with poor prognoses following prostate surgery. But before results could be measured, leukemia struck and researchers halted the study, declaring the leukemia findings \"an unacceptable risk to patients.\"While the assumption is that the drug caused the leukemia -- a disease commonly associated with children and the elderly -- it\\'s still unproved at this point.Mitoxantrone is not a worthless drug, say some experts. Since its release a decade ago, it has been used to decrease bone pain for men with advanced prostate cancer and to treat multiple sclerosis and, ironically, adult leukemia. Comments: 1. Thanks for this blog.This study raises the question \"How much risk is too much?\" Three men out of 488 in the arm of the study involving mitoxantrone developed leukemia. Three men equates to .6% - less than 1%, meaning that more than 99% did not develop leukemia. Of course, if these were the first three men in the study, that would make a difference, but the accompanying article did not address that level of information.The men in the study all had poor prognoses following prostate cancer surgery. It\\'s a reasonable assumption that many had positive surgical margins or positive lymph nodes. Therefore, it was a group that was willing to take some risks, to place some bets, because sitting still was not a great option. All the men had hormonal blockade as I understand it, which does quite well for most men at high risk for recurrence. Giving mitoxantrone might have upped their odds of success, but now we will not know if the added benefit, if any, was worth the added burden.How much risk is too much is a tough question, one that clearly depends on the risks of not taking the extra step. My hunch is the researchers did the right thing in this case, but I have a strong impression that sometimes researchers are too gun-shy and pull back from a potentially useful tactic with substantial benefit just because it involves a risk that is truly miniscule.This is what has happened so far on a broad scale with finasteride, a drug that has been proven to reduce prostate cancer incidence by 25%. A apparent possible one percent increase of more aggressive cancer spooked the media and most of the medical establishment. Fortunately, that increase is now understood to be basically due to an increase in detection capability, and finasteride has been cleared. Unfortunately, most doctors, patients and the media have not yet caught on. In this era of scarce resources for health care, with over 40 million uninsured in the US, reducing the incidence of prostate cancer by 50,000 cases per year (25% of roughly 200,000 new diagnoses per year) would probably save a lot of money, even allowing for the amount required to provide this generically available drug.Jim Waldenfels (website: <A href=\"http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147\" rel=nofollow>http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147</A>)',\n",
       " 'Cancer patients who have heart attacks are typically not treated with a course of life-saving aspirin because of the belief that these patients might experience lethal bleeding.This belief is now under dispute and researchers at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center say that without aspirin, the majority of these patients will die. Their arguments, subject of a recent study, will be published in the February 1 issue of the journal Cancer.Aspirin has been viewed as harmful because of its tendency to thin blood. Because cancer patients can experience low platelet counts and abnormal clotting, aspirin has been considered a contraindication. But this study found that nine of 10 cancer patients with low platelet counts who experienced heart attacks and who did not receive aspirin died. Only one patient died, however, in a group of 17 cancer patients who received aspirin. This conclusion -- that aspirin helps people with cancer just as it does for people without cancer -- may help medical professionals determine guidelines for treatment of heart attacks in cancer patients. Because right now, physicians are uncertain about how to balance treatment for both conditions. Comments: ',\n",

       " 'Today I watched a video of myself. I was interviewing my grandmother about her 83 years worth of memories -- a project my husband and I dreamed up so that my grandma\\'s life story would live on long after her death. The video was taped in May 2000, three years before my grandma died and four and a half years before I was diagnosed with cancer. My hair was long and blond and straight, like it had been since I was a little girl, and it was twisted and clipped on the top of my head. I instantly longed for this hair -- and for my grandma too -- and just as I was convincing myself that my post-chemotherapy dark, curly hair was merely a new phase of my life -- much like the phase of living without my grandma -- my six-year-old son entered the room, looked at the TV screen and said, \"Mommy, I really like your hair like that.\" \"I do too,\" I told Joey.\"Can you get it back?\" he said.\"No, I can\\'t get it back,\" I replied, knowing that I would never bleach my hair back to its original natural color and that the forces of nature will forever prevent me from removing the curl that today looked somewhat like what frames a lion\\'s face.So, no, I can\\'t get my hair back. And I can\\'t get my grandma back. But I am thankful for the video that captures us together, talking and laughing and remembering. And should my own grandchildren ever wish to interview me when I am 83 years old, I will definitely tell them about my sweet and spunky grandma and all of her touching stories. And I will tell them about the great blond hair I had the privilege of wearing for the first 34 years of my life. Comments: ',\n",

       " 'Women 65 and older with early stage breast cancer who receive radiation after a lumpectomy -- a breast-sparing surgery to remove cancerous tumors -- may receive from radiation a decreased risk of recurrence. But a new study suggests many forgo the treatment due to its drawbacks.Results of the study revealed women who received a lumpectomy and no radiation were 60 percent more likely to experience a breast cancer recurrence or a new tumor than those receiving either a mastectomy or lumpectomy followed by radiation.Lead study author Ann Geiger of Wake Forest University wants women to get the message that while her study did not address how radiation affects survival, it does decrease the risk of recurrence. And this is particularly important because older women are more likely to develop breast cancer yet are less likely to treat their diseases as aggressively as younger women.For some, like older women with very small tumors, the risk of dying is very low and so radiation may not be a priority. For other older women, like those in their 80s, the hassle and discomfort of a six-week course of radiation might not be worth it. But for those on the fence about whether or not to sign up for radiation treatment, it seems submitting to the treatment definitely has its merits. Comments: 1. As reported by the American Cancer Society, some elderly women with early-stage breast cancer may be able to safely skip radiation treatments, a new study suggests. The researchers came to this conclusion after comparing two groups of elderly women treated for small cancers. One group was given tamoxifen after undergoing lumpectomy, while the other got tamoxifen and radiation. The finding reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, means some women may be able to avoid the time and expense of radiation treatment, as well as possible side effects such as breast and arm swelling, breast pain, and poorer cosmetic results.Even though giving radiation after a lumpectomy can delay a relapse of breast cancer, it does not seem to improve overall survival. Radiation therapy still has the potential to damage the heart, even though modern techniques have made the treatments safer than ever. In some clinical studies, women who had radiation in addition to tamoxifen reported worse breast pain, swelling, and cosmetic outcomes in the first few years of follow-up compared to women who took only tamoxifen. After about 4 years, though, these effects were about the same in both groups.Kevin Hughes, M.D., the lead study author feels that if a patient does not need to have radiation therapy, their quality of life can improve significantly. The researchers noted that women who received radiation therapy in addition to Tamoxifen were less likely to have their cancer return in the same breast or nearby tissue. However, elderly women already have a low risk of recurrence because their breast cancers tend to be less aggressive at that age, without the added toxicity profiles of radiation.And elderly women also are more prone to have other illnesses that are more likely to be deadly before breast cancer would be. It may be possible to reduce the risk of relapse even further by adding aromatase inhibitors to treatment. Studies of younger women have shown that these newer drugs can lower the risk of breast cancer recurrence even more when given after a course of tamoxifen.Dr. Hughes has pointed out that the local recurrence risk in both groups of their study was extremely low and women who have not had radiation have the option of another lumpectomy if they do have a recurrence in the same breast. Once a patient has had radiation, they must have a mastectomy if the tumor recurs. Every woman and her physician should choose a treatment plan by weighing the risk of a slight increase of local recurrence verses the patient\\'s time, adverse effects and financial cost.A lot of studies push many physicians and scientists toward the goal of finding the tiniest improvements in treatment rather than genuine breakthoughs, that rewards academic achievement and publication even though their proven activity has little to do with \"curing\" cancer. It falls short of meeting the toughest standard for improving overall survival.New England Journal of Medicine (Vol. 351, No.10: 971-977) 2. The study showed:In a records-based analysis of outcomes of than 1,800 patients, the investigators also found that breast-conserving surgery without radiation was associated with a 3.5-fold (350%)risk for local or regional recurrence of primary breast cancer, Women had a benefit from adjuvant radiation regardless of their age, co-morbidities, or the use of tamoxifen (among those with hormone-sensitive tumors), the authors noted.\"We recommend that mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery with radiation therapy, along with adequate duration of adjuvant hormone therapy for patients with hormone-responsive tumors, be considered standard therapy in women of all ages and with all co-morbidity burdens, except for women with very limited life expectancies,\" the investigators wrote.The above commenter misses the point:\"Older women\\'s risk of dying from tiny breast tumors is extremely low, so a survival benefit from radiation is unlikely, says breast cancer surgeon Kevin Hughes of Massachusetts General Hospital.\"Cut the risk of recurrence by 350% and, thus later treatment? Women will choose that.3. For some, like older women with very small tumors, the risk of dying is very low and so radiation may not be a priority. For other older women, like those in their 80s, the hassle and discomfort of a six-week course of radiation might not be worth it. BUT, for those on the fence about whether or not to sign up for radiation treatment, it seems submitting to the treatment definitely has its merits, a 350% reduction in recurrence.4. All 636 elderly women in the Hughes\\' study had small tumors (no larger than 2 cm) that were removed by a breast-conserving surgery, and all were given 5 years of tamoxifen therapy afterward. But about half of the women (317) were also given radiation therapy.Women who received radiation therapy in addition to tamoxifen were less likely to have their cancer return in the same breast or nearby tissue. Just 2 women in that group (1%) saw their cancer return locally, while 16 women who received only tamoxifen (4%) had a local relapse in that period, statistically insignificant in the real world.The local recurrence risk in both groups was extremely low, and women who have not had radiation have the option of another lumpectomy if they do have recurrence in the same breast. Once a patient has had radiation, they must have a mastectomy if the tumor recurs.Rates of mastectomy because of a subsequent recurrence were 1% in the group that received radiation, and 2% in the tamoxifen-only group -- a statistical dead-heat. Rates of distant spread were also the same: 7 women in each group saw their cancer return in another part of their body. There was no difference in survival, either: 3 women in each group died of breast cancer, and about equal numbers died from other causes.This study finds that giving radiation after lumpectomy can possibly delay a relapse of breast cancer, but in the elderly, it does not seem to improve overall survival. 5. MammoSite is a form of localized radiation that treats only the area of the breast immediately around the site of the tumor. Traditional radiation treats the entire breast in which the tumor was located. And MammoSite reduces the duration of radiation treatments from six weeks to just five days, a trend to scale down the scope of treatments for breast cancer.During the MammoSite treatment, a small balloon with a thin catheter attached to it is placed into the cavity where the tumor had been removed. As the patient lies on a table in a sealed room, a radioactive seed is administered by machine through the catheter into the balloon. The seed remains in the balloon for about seven minutes, at which time it\\'s automatically removed. The patient undergoes therapy twice a day, at intervals at least six hours apart, for five days.The patient then takes Tamoxifen, a drug that blocks the effects of estrogen on the body, to treat tumors that are sensitive to estrogen. This less intensive treatment usually results in fewer side effects and can be just as effective as more aggressive treatment. It is an option for early breast cancer patients while a solitary tumor is small, and has not spread to the lumph nodes. The advantages are that radiation treatment is concentrated to the local tumor bed.For many decades, hormonally responsive breast cancer has been managed by use of sequential hormone therapies: oopherectomy, adrenalectomy, diethylstilbesterol, testosterone, progesterone, tamoxifen, aminoglutethimide, and now arimidex.Armidex may be more effective than tamoxifen in preventing recurrence, but it\\'s unclear whether or not treatment with arimidex following recurrence on tamoxifen will not have a \"salvage\" effect. The recurrence-free data with arimidex are pretty impressive, however, the osteoporosis and fractures are obviously a problem.<A href=\"http://www.mammosite.com/Mammosite.htm\" rel=nofollow>http://www.mammosite.com/Mammosite.htm</A>',\n",

       " 'A drug commonly used to minimize the toxic effects of chemotherapy has been shown in mice to cause bone loss and promote tumor growth, according to the results of a recent study.This drug, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) -- also known as Neupogen, Neulasta, and Granocyte -- helps restore white blood cell counts that take a beating during chemotherapy, protecting cancer patients from an increased risk of infection.According to researchers, G-CSF -- essentially a growth factor -- encourages bone breakdown. And any therapy that decreases bone density can enhance tumor growth in bones. So doctors are urged to closely monitor their patients during chemotherapy with regular bone density scans. They can also prescribe medications to prevent bone loss if necessary. And patients can protect their bones by consuming enough calcium and vitamin D and engaging in regular exercise.Currently, research on cancer patients treated with G-CSF have not yielded the same strong results researchers found among mice.The details of this study appear online in the journal Blood, and will be published in an upcoming print issue.

What DCA does is revive the mitochondrial function, encouraging the death of cancer cells.The overwhelming hope is that DCA will move right to human testing. But the overwhelming fear is that it will not -- because of economic reasons. There is no longer a patent on DCA so it is not owned by any one company.

It was created especially for me by more than 20 talented friends who crafted the lavender, pale green, and white patches into a flowered work of beauty and serenity and warmth. It sits at the end of my bed -- folded neatly and by coincidence matching the color scheme of my room -- until the time at which I turn in for the night and I spread it out and allow it to comfort me and warm me. It has covered me every night since the night it was delivered to my doorstep by a few of the friends who helped make it -- and the peace it brings me today is no less than the peace it brought me the first night I used it -- the night when I was weak and sick and struggling with breast cancer.The peaceful feelings that stir in me might be connected to the compelling words that are written on my quilt. Each friend signed her name and many wrote personal messages on the fabric of this masterpiece -- and the words speak loudly. One message reads, Before flowers grow, there must be rain. You will get a whole garden and Friends are always there and We are thinking about you today and Love Life. Live Strong. I can't pass by my quilt without seeing these powerful words and when this blanket covers me at night and I wrap up and snuggle in it, I know I am cushioned in love.I am not only the happy recipient of this hand-crafted gift -- I also got a turn playing seamstress when this same group of women gathered to make a quilt for a friend who was diagnosed with kidney cancer shortly after I rebounded from my own cancer treatment. This quilt -- in shades of blue and green -- is also covered with personal signatures and messages.

       " 'A U.K. researcher confirms what many dog lovers already know -- dogs are good for your health.Apparently, dog owners are generally healthier than non-pet-owners. They have lower blood pressure and cholesterol, suffer fewer minor ailments, and stray from serious medical problems too. Dogs can prevent their owners from getting sick, help them recover more quickly when they do fall ill, and they can even warn of cancer, heart attack, epileptic seizures, and hypoglycemia, says Dr. Deborah Wells from the Canine Behaviour Centre of Queens University in Northern Ireland.Wells, whose study is published in the British Journal of Health Psychology, says dogs buffer us from stress -- a well-known cause of illness -- and promote general well-being. Owning a dog leads to increased physical activity and increases development of social interactions -- both of which minimize stress and contribute to human health.While Wells found those who own both dogs and cats benefit from their pets, dog owners enjoy improved health for much longer than cat owners.

       " 'Nearly a decade ago, women in Long Island began to worry about their high rates of breast cancer. So they advocated and lobbied and pushed until a public law was passed that allowed for the creation of the Long Island Breast Cancer Project. Funded by both the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, great data has emerged from this project -- like the data linking breast cancer and household pesticides.Although much research has linked cancer with pesticides in work and industrial settings, few studies have investigated what these chemicals can do in households -- until now, thanks to research conducted as part of The Long Island Breast Cancer Project.Published online in the December 13 American Journal of Epidemiology, researchers found an association between lifetime residential pesticide use and breast cancer risk in a sample of 1,508 Long Island women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1996 and 1997. These women were compared to 1,556 random controls. All women were asked to self-report their pesticide exposure and to offer blood samples for the study of organochlorine compound levels -- found in lawn and garden products.As expected, researchers found an increased breast cancer risk for women whose blood samples showed the highest levels of organochlorine compounds. They also found it hard to find women who did not use lawn and garden pesticides to some degree.Use of household pesticides has infiltrated our society, says researcher Susan Teitelbaum, assistant professor in the department of community medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, who reports she is happy to see a movement toward use of alternative methods, like integrated pest management.Teitelbaum has just one recommendation as result of this study. It\\'s quite simple really -- stop using pesticides. Comments: 1.

       " 'It\\'s an unsettling journey -- the pursuit of the five-year cancer survival mark. Some say each year of cancer survival makes the future more of a sure thing. And so surviving five years -- the traditional landmark of real remission -- is a big accomplishment. But then there\\'s the perspective of numbers that for me say I have a 93 percent chance of surviving breast cancer for five years. After that, though, there\\'s no telling what will happen. So I am eagerly awaiting the moment when I cross the five-year finish line as I anxiously realize this very same moment may also signal a more dismal outlook.The paradox hit me straight in the face yesterday as I was waiting for my radiation oncologist to give me another six-month all clear announcement. I was reading the January/February 2007 issue of Coping magazine while I waited. And as I flipped through the pages, I landed right at these words: Studies show that half of all breast cancer recurrences occur after completion of five years of standard tamoxifen therapy. Additionally, a third of women with estrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer experience a recurrence, and more of half of these recurrences occur more than five years after surgery.Now this doesn\\'t apply directly to me. My breast cancer was estrogen receptor-negative which makes me a non-candidate for tamoxifen. And this is what scares me. My tumor was aggressive and while my treatment was also aggressive, I don\\'t get the extra five-year protection from hormone therapy. If women taking this drug can have recurrences after completing the therapy, I wonder what\\'s in store for me having not had it. Maybe I\\'m making comparisons that don\\'t amount to any real conclusions. Perhaps my type of disease allows for a more secure future. Or perhaps it places me on shaky ground. I don\\'t know for sure. And I don\\'t think I\\'ll dive any deeper into research than I already have. Instead, I will live for today -- while enjoying the announcement my oncologist shared with me yesterday. All clear! Comments: 1. I am a 14 year breast cancer survivor. I had a very large tumor. Hormone receptors were negative. I had chemo and radiation. A year after my diagnosis, my older sister was diagnosed with the same type of breast cancer, although her hormone receptors were positive. It was a very aggressive, fast growing cancer, and while my prognosis wasn\\'t too bad, hers was very bleak. They said she would maybe live 2 years if they were very aggressive with chemo and if she was extremely lucky. She\\'s a 13 year survivor!In my opinion, attitude helps a bunch! I started a mail order business selling headwear for chemo therapy patients (Chemo Savvy), and talk to lots of women with breast cancer and am always amazed and impressed that most of these women are so positive and upbeat in spite of a dreary prognosis. Sometimes these women call me back after a few years to tell me how they\\'re doing, and it really makes my day! Keep a good attitude and don\\'t let the statistics get to you. 2. I find the statistics alternately distressing and reassuring. My husband has asked me to just stop reading too much, but I\\'d rather be overwhelmed with information than be in the dark and wondering to myself: what are my chances? is this coming back? I try to live one day at a time, but I have a 2 year old son, a constant reminder of the Future and all it can behold.The lack of confidence comes from being Her2 positive, early stage but with 2 nodes positive. I\\'m done with chemo, currently doing rads and have a year of herceptin ahead. Can you point me to the definitive source of info on her2+cancer? info beyond the often repeated \"its more aggressive and more likely to spread...\"thanks. i\\'m a great follower of your blog',\n",
       " \"On December 8, 2006, I wrote about a Danish study investigating the possible link between cell phone use and cancer. This largest-ever study of it's kind put fears to rest. Cell phones do not cause cancer, said researchers who announced that cell phone users -- even long-term users -- are at no more risk of developing cancer than their non-cell phone using counterparts. There's just no biological basis for concern about radio waves, reported the lead investigator of this study. But another newer study reports something entirely different.Long-term mobile phone users are more likely to develop cancer -- brain cancer, on the side of the head where the phone is held -- according to the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority in Finland. It will all be detailed later this year in the International Journal of Cancer, but the general gist of the study is already circulating.The study -- the second one to suggest an increased risk of cancer due to emissions from cell phones -- found that people who regularly used cell phones for more than 10 years were 40 percent more likely to develop nervous system tumors called gliomas. Comparisons were made between 1,521 people with gliomas and 3,301 people without the tumors. While no connections were initially made between the phones and cancer, a link was found when researchers specifically focused on those who had used their phones for more than 10 years.Short-term use of cell phones has never been linked to cancer. That's good. But I tend to believe cell phones are going to become even more a staple of our technologically-driven lives than they are now. And so 10 years may actually be considered short-term one day -- which means we all may soon be at risk.For now, until research becomes more conclusive, we get to pick and choose which study to stand behind. So take your pick -- and stay tuned for future scientific revelations. Comments: 1. Who funded that original study, the phone company?\",\n",

       " 'One week ago, researchers found themselves humbled by the disappointing fact that promising cancer drug Avastin had failed to help patients with pancreatic cancer live longer. In fact, not only did the drug fail to extend survival, it actually caused adverse side effects such high blood pressure and bleeding in the stomach and intestine.In a study of 600 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, those who received Avastin in addition to standard chemotherapy lived for only six months -- the same amount of time as those who received chemotherapy alone. Earlier studies predicted Avastin might improve survival. It worked in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. And so it was no surprise that crowds of pancreatic cancer patients wanted a shot at this potential wonder drug that in the end turned out -- for them -- to be not so wondrous. Comments: 1. Avastin works by choking off the blood vessels that provide a tumor with oxygen and nutrients (angiogenesis). Angiogenesis is essential for the growth and metastasis (spread) of cancer. A growing tumor requires nutrients and oxygen, which helps it grow, invade nearby tissue, and metastasize. To reach these nutrients, the tumor builds new blood vessels. In fact, growing tumors can become inactive if they can\\'t find a new supply of nutrients.Angiogenesis starts when cancer cells produce a variety of growth factors and other activators (biologic molecules that begin a process). Growth factors cause endothelial cells (the cells that line blood vessels) to produce chemicals that break down the nearby tissue and the extracellular matrix (the spaces between cells). Then, the endothelial cells divide into more cells and begin building new blood vessels. Other elements, such as stromal cells (cells that form connective tissue), provide structural support for the new blood vessels.Because angiogenesis is necessary in the growth and spread of cancer, each part of the angiogenesis process is a potential target for new cancer therapies. The assumption is that if a drug can stop the tumor from receiving the supply of nutrients, the tumor will \"starve\" and die. However, there are so many agents out there now, doctors have a confusing array of choices. They don\\'t know how to mix them together in the right order.Avastin (bevacizumab) is a monoclonal antibody, a type of genetically engineered protein. Monoclonal antibodies are substances made in the laboratory that recognize and then attach to specific proteins on the outside of cancer cells. They may be used to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells or to deliver radiation, chemotherapy, or other biologic therapies more directly to a tumor.Avastin directly binds to a protein in the body called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which spurs the growth of blood vessels. Angiogenesis is dependent on VEGF. Avastin directly binds to VEGF to directly inhibit angiogenesis (microvasculature regression). Within 24 hours of VEGF inhibition, endothelial cells have been shown to shrivel, retract, fragment and die by apoptosis. VEGF can cut off the supply of vessels that spring up to feed a tumor, but there is some uncertainty how Avastin works, or if it can get \"inside\" a cell.VEGF is an important activator of angiogenesis. Like the name indicates, VEGF causes endothelial cells to grow. Research has shown that oncogenes (genes that help cancer cells grow), cytokines (substances produced by the immune system), and hypoxia (a low-oxygen environment, which is common in tissues around solid tumors) can all directly or indirectly activate VEGF, thereby starting angiogenesis.VEGF causes angiogenesis by attaching to special receptors (proteins on the \"outside\" of cancer cells that act like doorways), and this action starts a series of chemical reactions \"inside\" the cell. Because VEGF is so important to angiogenesis, it is a target of new cancer treatments. Avastin blocks a receptor for VEGF. Erbitux is also a monoclonal antibody but directed at a different protein. In addition to VEGF, researchers have identified a dozen other activators of angiogenesis, some of which are similar to VEGF. PTK/ZK (vatalanib) is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with broad specificity that targets all VEGF receptors (a multi-VEGFR inhibitor), the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and c-KIT. It is a multi-VEGFR inhibitor that inhibits the activity of all known receptors that bind VEGF.There are multiple ways by which tumors can evolve that are independent of VEGF and independent of angiogenesis. Tumors can acquire a blood supply by three different mechanisms: angiogenesis; co-option of existing blood vessels; and vasculogenic mimicry. All must be inhibited to consistently starve tumors of oxygen.Instead of growing new blood vessels, tumor cells can just grow along existing blood vessels. This process, called co-option, cannot be stopped with drugs that inhibit new blood vessel formation. Some types of cancers form channels that carry blood, but are not actual blood vessels. Drugs that target new blood vessel formation also cannot stop this process, called vasculogeneic mimicry. The realization is that starving tumors by shutting off their blood flow requires that all three mechanisms be addressed.2. Thank you, that was very informative!3. Mr. Pawelski,That was very informative information and well said so that the average non-medical person could understand! Thank you for taking the time to post that! I just wish it would have been explained to me prior to agreeing to the therapy for my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s colon cancer. We were handed print-outs from the nurses that gave general drug information along with side affects that include the general chemo side effects such as nausea, vomiting, hair loss etc. But we were NEVER informed of the more serious and fatal side effects until it was too late. I suppose you can say that Avastin worked too well in our case. After my father came out of emergency surgery where they removed his entire colon this week, we were then told of the serious side effects and how Avastin worked. Needless to say, Avastin not only cut off the blood supply to the tumor, it also cut off the blood supply to the colon entirely causing the tissue to die. This placed my father in a very critical situation....Surgery after Avastin is causing him not to heal now, Avastin caused him to loose his colon, and Avastin has caused the fluid around his heart and given him blood clots in the lungs (this is what the doctors tell us). To me Avastin is not worth the $5000/per dose price tag it comes with. Drug manufactures and Doctors should speak honestly and openly about how the drug works and about ALL the possible outcomes prior to prescribing and administering a drug. Where is the compassion in the medical world these days... Do doctors not remember or believe that â\\x80\\x9ctheirâ\\x80? patients are our loved family members? I am sure the doctor remembers to tell his/her father about the side effects BEFORE giving him such a dangerous drug. Maybe we should have the drug makers put the warnings on those cute little ink pens instead of the companyâ\\x80\\x99s mascot and drug names so they can remember what can go wrong while writing these prescriptions/therapies. Which is more important to remember .... the drug company mascot or the fatal side effects?4. The below information applies to gastrointestinal perforation/wound healing complications when Avastin is given as adjuvant chemotherapy (after surgery).Gastrointestinal perforation (the development of an abnormal break in the wall of the stomach, intestines, or colon) occurred in an increased incidence in patients treated with Avastin. These episodes often resulted in an abscess formation. This may be due to the impaired wound healing induced by Avastin. Therefore, it is recommended that Avastin not be given within at least 28 days following major surgery. In addition, the surgical incision should be fully healed prior to initiation of Avastin. This is a severe complication.The typical presentation of wound breakdown and gastrointestinal perforation is abdominal pain (often severe) with associated constipation and/or vomiting. Therefore, any severe abdominal pain should be regarded as an emergency. Obviously, discontinuation of Avastin is warranted in these instances.However, your father received Avastin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (before surgery).5. There was some information put out by Genentech about advanced ovarian cancer patients experiencing gastrointestinal perforations with Avastin. It said that it was higher than expected number. The problem could be a direct result of the drug\\'s ability to kill tumor cells that have replaced healthy bowel tissue, leading to a dead area that then perforates.Ovarian cancer commonly involves bowel walls. With conventional chemotherapy, as the tumor melts away, new connective tissue forms a patch. So bowel perforations are rare. But Avastin can inhibit the growth of capillaries into newly forming normal tissue, as well as in tumor tissue. So this would be a complication. If one does not have any known bowel involvement, one would probably be ok.It was suggested that none of the other \"targeted\" drugs like Erbitux, Iressa or Tarceva work the same way and should not share the problem seen with Avastin. Again, this was with \"advanced\" cancer patients.6. The risk of serious GI side effects remains low with AvastinIn clinical studies, the incidence of GI perforation (perforation, fistula formation, and/or intra-abdominal abscess) was 0.9% for bevacizumab-treated NSCLC patients compared with 2.4% for those with colorectal cancer.This is new data: <A href=\"http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/550583\" rel=nofollow>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/550583</A>and it\\'s possible that cancer patients have not been informed because the data was not there. Clinical trials are often not large enough for physicians to make this determination, yet the public demands FDA approval of effective medications. It\\'s only when large #s of patients receive the medication, after approval, that side effects are seen.We should not be so quick to accuse doctors and researchers of a lack of openness and honesty. They wait for the data just as you and I do.7. There are good sides and there are bad sides to all drugs. What needs to be learned, and obviously sometimes the hard way, is how do drugs work. This is particularly true when they are biologics, they can be working in ways and speed that we arn\\'t used to. It is a learning process and it can be a painful one, but we just need to learn how to use it.Avastin is indeed associated with wound dehiscence, a rupture of a surgical wound to discharge its contents. The vascular inhibitory effects are predisposed to these complications. The mechanism of action may more reflect the Vascular Permeability Factor effects rather than the anti-angiogenesis effects. Maybe Avastin wasn\\'t the cause of this complication. Avastin as a single agent is relatively ineffective in most tumor types, other than Renal cancer, a disease known to be driven by the VHL-&gt;HIF1a-&gt;VEGF pathway. Beyond that, it appears better to deliver the effects of other classes of drugs.Some of these new \"smart\" therapies often get a pass on toxicities because they are \"sexy.\" So darn cool! Herceptin in the adjuvant setting is an example. There are tumors that are Her2/neu positive which don\\'t respond to Herceptin. There are tumors which are estrogen receptor positive which don\\'t respond to Tamoxifen. There are tumors which are c-kit positive which don\\'t respond to Gleevec. The problem is that few drugs work the way we think and few physicians take the time to think through what it is they are using them for.8. I\\'d be interested in knowing what you mean when you say that these therapies get a pass on toxicities? With few patients entering clinical trials and ill patients urging approval of these drugs, perhaps you want many more years and many more patients entered in clinical trials before approval?Also \"few drugs work the way we think and few physicians take the time to think through what it is they are using them for.\"So, if I go to my oncologist today, I should go with the understanding that it is likely that he or she does not know why I\\'m getting my chemotherapy or how it works?Could you elaborate?Thank you.9. Any number of oncologists\\' training and practice does not include studying and understanding the cancer cell and its relationship to the rest of the body\\'s cellular mechanics and communication. Cellular biology is a very complex and fascinating body of knowledge which a number of private clinical scientists appreciate and understand. They are the \"geeks\" of cancer medicine (the M.D./Ph.D\\'s). They are constantly looking for ways to reverse that cell physiology and in a non-toxic way as possible. Continued development of better cancer drugs is driven by increased understanding of cancer cell biology. Their goal is to develop agents that are effective at killing tumor cells while sparing normal cells in the process. Perhaps if these physicians did rotations like medical students do, they would develop more of an understanding and appreciation of what it is they are doing.',\n",
       " 'What a gift it would be if it were possible to sleep through cancer, literally sleep through the entire experience -- from diagnosis through the end of treatment -- and wake up on the other end of the bad dream. Unfortunately, this isn\\'t possible. We must be alert and aware and active in our own plans for survival. All we are typically permitted are now-and-then naps and nighttime sleep -- if we can manage to actually sleep at night.My sleep was never disturbed during my cancer journey. Night after night, just after my head hit my pillow, my body drifted right to sleep -- only waking for brief trips to the bathroom and to get out of bed the next day. I might have had an occasional sleepless night. But for the most part, I count myself as one lucky cancer patient, blessed with restful and regular sleep. Not all cancer patients are privileged sleepers. And with all I was enduring during my own cancer ordeal -- emotions, hospitalizations, treatments, side effects, and pain -- it\\'s a wonder I was able to manage so well in the sleep department.Sleep is critical for maintaining strength and energy while fighting cancer -- while living life in general really. When nighttime sleep is disrupted, interrupted, or downright impossible, normal functioning and healing are compromised. So the quest for good, quality sleep should make its way to the top of your cancer to-do list. And if you are not sure just how to begin such a quest, consider these seven strategies for sleeping through cancer -- compliments of Marie-Helene Savard, doctoral student in psychology, and Dr. Josee Savard, associate professor and researcher of psychology at Laval University Cancer Research Center in Quebec, Canada.   Set aside at least one hour to relax before going to bed.   Go to bed only when you feel sleepy -- which is not the same as fatigue.   If you can\\'t fall asleep or can\\'t go back to sleep after 20 or 30 minutes,   get out of bed and leave the bedroom. Do something else -- and only go back to   bed when you feel sleepy again. Repeat as necessary.   Get up at the same time every day -- regardless of how much sleep you got.   Use an alarm clock to wake.   Use your bedroom only for sleep and sexual activities. Avoid reading,   working, watching TV, or listening to the radio in the bedroom.   Avoid napping. If you must take a nap, do so before 3:00 PM and for less   than one hour.   Keep realistic expectations about sleep -- avoid worrying about the amount   of sleep you should have or the amount of time it takes you to fall asleep --   and try to become tolerant of your lack of sleep. Sweet dreams. Comments: 1. Sleep Learning.It is proven that chronic sleep problems affect 40 million Americans every year and an average of 20 million to 30 million individuals will lose sleep on an occasional basis according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

And while their risk of diagnosis is much more hopeful than the reality facing women, men with breast cancer face their own version of a not-so-rosy reality. According to researchers at the University of California, Irvine, men treated for breast cancer face a very real chance of getting cancer again. Their study found that 11.5 percent of men with breast cancer develop second primary cancers -- mostly in the breast, stomach, and skin -- within two months following initial treatment.\"Even more disturbing, we found that men with breast cancer are diagnosed with later-stage disease and that patients with onset of the disease at a young age are even more likely to develop a second cancer,\" said Hoda Anton-Culver, chief of epidemiology in the UCI School of Medicine.In light of these findings, researchers recommend men with breast cancer be closely monitored for a second onset of cancer.

       " 'One of the first books I read after my breast cancer diagnosis was issued in hardback in 1986 -- 20 years ago -- and then was published again and reissued and reprinted in 1990, 1998, and 2002.While the cover has changed and perhaps some wording too, the message in this book -- Love, Medicine, &amp; Miracles by Bernie S. Siegel, M.D. -- remains unchanged.&nbsp; And it is inside the covers of this book that I keep learning that I have the capacity and power to become an exceptional patient -- despite the fact that I\\'ve been faced with a life-shattering diagnosis of cancer.Siegel, a surgeon who stopped operating to instead educate others on the lessons he learned as a surgeon, teaches about the exceptional patients he has encountered and how the mind can drastically affect the body. Some patients will do almost anything rather than alter their lives to increase their chances for survival, he says -- and eight out of 10 patients who are offered the choice between surgery or a change in lifestyle to cure them of illness will choose the surgery. It hurts less, it\\'s quicker, it\\'s easier than changing a whole way of being, they say. But then there are exceptional patients who will do anything to improve their lives, who achieve a peace of mind that sends the brain a \"live\" message instead of a depressed, conflicted, fearful state of mind that sends the brain a \"die\" message. Science may not be able to explain it -- but miracles do occur for exceptional patients. Exceptional patients make illness matter -- they allow cancer to direct them in positive life directions while other patients may believe cancer is nothing but a death sentence. Everyone can be an exceptional patient, according to Siegel. And the best time to start is before becoming sick. Most people don\\'t make full use of their lives until a near-fatal wake-up call alarms them into action. It doesn\\'t have to be a last-minute awakening, though -- the mind\\'s capacity to triumph is available all the time, and it can be called to action before something disastrous happens.I always come back to one specific story in Siegel\\'s book that reminds me of the power of the mind. Siegel tells of a group of patients in a study -- part of the group was given chemotherapy and the others were given a placebo. All believed they were receiving chemotherapy, though, and all were told hair loss would result from the therapy. Of the patients who received the placebo, many suffered from hair loss. They were told it would happen, believed it would happen, and it did happen -- even though they did not actually receive chemotherapy. Wow.I don\\'t know if I am an exceptional patient yet -- although I have been able to maintain a mostly positive attitude throughout my cancer crusade. But I would like to do better -- and that keeps me coming back to this book for more direction and inspiration.&nbsp; Comments: 1. I was diagnosed with bone cancer in 1987 and my oncologist recommended this book to me. I believe I was an exceptional patient and his book helped me see that in myself. Now 19 years later, at the age of 47, I have been diagnosed with breast cancer. I\\'ll have to buy a new copy since I loaned my original to someone who still needs it, but I plan to be exceptional again, God willing. Jacki, your an inspiration and a terrific writer.

       " 'I just finished reading the words of Mark Raymond Clements -- and the words of his wife, Marianne, written when Mark was too ill to comment. I am overcome and overwhelmed with emotion because each string of sentences filling the pages of the Clements family homepage has touched me, inspired me, and saddened me all at the same time.Clements was diagnosed in October 2005 with cholangiocarcinoma, a rare cancer of the bile duct normally found in people in their 70s. \"There is no known cure,\" writes Clements. \"It does not respond well to chemotherapy. It is fast moving.\"And fast moving it was. Surgery -- rarely a good option for this cancer -- was attempted but without success. \"After they opened him up, they discovered that the cancer had just spread too far,\" Marianne writes. \"They closed him back up.\" Chemotherapy came next and while there were some hopeful moments -- \"overall distribution of the disease has decreased\" -- the overwhelming course of Clement\\'s disease continued on a fast track. And by June 2006, Clements realized, \"the cruel reality of CANCER hits like a brick wall,\" when a CT scan revealed the presence of as many as 20 new tumors in his liver.The Clements family never abandoned hope and were steadfast in their faith as cancer continued to dominate their lives. In October -- one year after diagnosis -- when Marianne believed doctors were sending a let\\'s make you as comfortable as we can message, the family began pursuing alternative methods. But by December, when it had become clear treatment of any kind would no longer help, Mark Clements was welcomed by the loving arms of hospice -- where he remained until he passed away on January, 19, 2007.

       " 'This year alone, 215,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. And sadly, not all of them will be treated equally.Researchers reported last Tuesday that breast cancer patients who are either obese or poor are more likely to receive lower doses of chemotherapy. This might be why some women relapse and others do not, according to the researchers whose findings appear in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.This treatment discrepancy seems to stem from doctors who mean well and want to save certain women from severe side effects of chemotherapy. Doctors may be under-dosing obese patients, for example, because a larger dose based on weight could lead to worse side effects. There is no evidence this is true, however.As for socioeconomic status, researchers report doctors are assuming less-educated patients won\\'t stick with a tough course of treatment -- and so they prescribe less, in hopes patients will complete the regimen.Researchers found that severely obese women were four times more likely to get less chemotherapy than they need. Women with less than a high school education were three times more likely to receive low doses of chemotherapy. And women living in the South were almost six times more likely to come up short on the drugs they need to save their lives.\"We have new therapies and cures out there for many forms of cancer and sadly, sometimes we\\'re not curing people because they are not getting the full doses that should be standard,\" says Dr. Gary Lyman who led the study at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.

       " 'Radioactive cancer patients attending this weekend\\'s Super Bowl in Miami could be in for an alarming experience when they pass through radiation detectors designed to signal the presence of dirty bombs. Such cancer patients -- who have received treatment using radioisotopes and still may have tiny amounts of radioactive material in their bodies -- may want to come armed with letters from their doctors explaining their precarious set of circumstances.The use of radioisotopes in medicine is growing -- and so is the use of radiation detectors in our security-conscious nation, which means patients are triggering alarms when they are not even aware they are being scanned, doctors and security officials say. Nearly 60,000 people a day in the United States undergo treatment or tests that leave traces of radioactive material in their bodies, according to the Society of Nuclear Medicine. These traces are not enough to hurt anyone, but they are enough to trigger radiation alarms for up to three months.Radioisotopes are commonly used to diagnose and treat certain cancers and thyroid disorders, to analyze heart function, and to scan bones and lungs. And many doctors already know to equip their patients with travel cards because of the problems they can encounter in public places.Nearly 20 million nuclear medical procedures were performed in the United States in 2005 -- up 15 percent from 2001. Clearly, the number of people who could be mistaken for terrorists is quite large. So if you are one of these people -- with the power to create a buzz in a public setting -- get your papers in order so you can quickly confirm your identity as nothing more than a cancer patient.

The next step for Daniels, whose husband will receive $500,000, is a hearing to consider punitive damages.Wyeth's lawyer argues that Prempro -- a combination of estrogen and progestin -- is still prescribed to women and suggests Daniel's breast cancer was caused by other risk factors, such as family history of the disease.

       " 'As evidence mounts, it\\'s becoming more and more clear that chemo brain, a mental fogginess that can result from chemotherapy, is a real concern and not just a convenient excuse cancer patients use to explain away their flighty and forgetful tendencies. It seems the brain really can suffer cognitive damage from the poisonous drugs that fight off deadly cancer cells. And sometimes, this damage is present years after treatment. Add to chemo brain the normal aging process as well as brain conditions such as mild cognitive impairment and even schizophrenia and the brain might not stand a chance of ever remembering anything. Unless we buy into the new concept of mental training -- somewhat like physical fitness training -- in which case we may be able to bring back a level of sharpness to our lives.Research suggests this type of training may delay mental decline. And Betty Hall, 85, who is taking a brain fitness class at her senior living complex in Illinois, says brain-enhancing activities are definitely helping her.Hall is participating in an eight-week program where she spends one hour per day, five days per week using a computer to match words and listen for details in stories. She says it\\'s helping her remember where she places her keys and her grocery lists -- and it\\'s even helping her in her bridge club.\"I\\'ve won four times out of the last five at bridge club, and I think the players are going to shoot me because I keep remembering the cards people have,\" she said. \"It\\'s much easier for me to concentrate . . . and I brag about it everywhere I go.\"One clinical professor of neurology says brain health programs will explode over the next few years because of the stunning findings on this front. One study shows relatively short training regimens, lasting just five or six weeks, improve functioning for as long as five years. And booster sessions help advance these gains. Study participants says their everyday tasks, like managing finances, are much easier after mental workouts. Another study of the computer software Hall uses shows the program shaves an average 10 years off the mental age of users.Not all mental training is alike, and different cognitive difficulties may call for different training protocols. But the simple fact that I can work out my brain like I can work out my body gives me hope that I can possibly reverse the effects of chemotherapy on my own foggy brain, that I can one day not worry anymore that I might find my check book in the refrigerator and my cell phone in my sock drawer. Bring on the workouts!Thanks to Bev, my brainy friend, for this story tip! Comments: ',\n",
       " 'Women in England are not showing up for their annual pap tests. And their absence from this critical screening opportunity is increasing their risk of cervical cancer -- a cancer that is curable if detected early.New figures reveal that 660,000 women between the ages of 25 and 29 are invited for screening in England. Nearly 80 percent of these women accepted their invitations and reported for their tests in 1995 -- but only 69.4 percent did so last year. Women aged 30 to 34 are also down in attendance -- by about 800 women per week. Essentially, this means about 2,000 women each year who have pre-cancerous cells are missing the chance for early detection and diagnosis. The Department of Health, now investigating the falling figures, attributes the decline to perhaps a not-so-successful screening program, discomfort about the procedure, or fear that the experience will be embarrassing.

       " 'National Cancer Institute director John Neiderhuber worries the NCI 2007 budget could be slashed by five to 10 percent. And he worries that key cancer research will inevitably come to a halt as a result.Worries stem from budget cuts proposed by President Bush. Cuts would cost the NCI between $36 million and $4.7 billion -- but Bush reports that NCI funding has doubled in the past 10 years and would still remain relatively high. And due to the recent American Cancer Society announcement that cancer deaths dropped for the second straight year, White House spokesman Tony Fratto says, \"We\\'re proud of the significant investment that we have made in cancer research. We\\'re also proud of the results showing that researchers are delivering on that investment.\"But researchers still worry. They worry cuts will undermine their successes. They feel like the rug is being pulled out from under them, just as they are making significant progress. They suspect 95 clinical trials could be postponed or cancelled, 3,000 patients could miss the opportunity of joining a trial, and some cancers will be completely eliminated from studies.\"There is a real cost in human life,\" says Allen Lichter, executive vice president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, of the more-than-monetary toll budget cuts will take on NCI research efforts.One study already on hold, pending funding decisions, is the next phase of a study evaluating whether a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors, can prevent breast cancer. Another research group has opted to stop studying brain tumors. This is a huge loss to patients with this type of cancer, says Lichter. It\\'s a huge loss to all of us really -- because cancer will affect each of us in some way, some day. And so with cut budgets come cut hopes, cut dreams, and sadly -- cut survival. Comments: 1. The administrations arguments for the cuts are prodigious, considering the wasted billions being spent in Iraq, not to mention, the loss of innocent lives to thousands of families. This effort can be overturned by contacting your elected represenatives in the Congress and Senate. The fact of the matter is researchers are leaving the field. With the remarkable advances, I feel we are on the verge of developing major break throughs. A better plan would be to advance a major increase in the cancer research budget. Rnmeyer2043@aol.com2. Thanks, Dubya, once again you\\'re demonstrated how you care about us. We\\'ll be sure to invite you to the funeral.Richard Day Gore3. The current administration seems collosally ignorant, blind and deaf when it comes to fighting cancer. I don\\'t believe those folks can be reached.However, the Democrats are now in charge of Congress, and they did place a high priority on health issues in the 2006 campaigns. The question is: are they going to make good on their commitments.News stories in the past days, including yesterday, stated that the House had passed a $463 billion spending bill after deleting earmarks. While the bill was generally tight fisted, a little extra money went to a few institutions. One was NIH. According to a Washington Post story, \"The National Institutes of Health would have an additional 500 research grants to administer because of almost $620 million in additional funding for the remainder of fiscal 2007, which will end on Sept. 30.\" I\\'m not sure how far that goes to restore what the NCI needs, but it seems likely that NCI would get a large part of the extra NIH funding. My impression is that the House and Senate Democratic leadership is working together on overall funding, and the President appears to be going along.Fingers crossed here.Jim Waldenfels4. This will trickle down to other research as well, or does this only affect NCI?Dmitriy <A href=\"http://www.refuter.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.refuter.com/</A>5.

They go something like this: the sun may actually fight skin cancer instead of causing it. According to a team of scientists at the University of New Mexico\\'s Cancer Research and Treatment Center, a little bit of ultraviolet B light is enough to stimulate a vitamin D immune response in the skin -- but it\\'s not enough to boost skin cancer risk.It\\'s still true that sunlight is the main cause of skin cancer. But limiting exposure is the key to preventing the disease -- and for promoting bone health and perhaps preventing colon cancer too.Researchers, whose findings are published in the March issue of Nature Immunology, suggest staying out of the sun for now -- because they don\\'t yet know what constitutes a little bit when it comes to UVB rays.

       " 'Secondhand smoke rears its ugly head once again -- this time in the form of study results revealing high levels of secondhand smoke in the workplace can double the risk of lung cancer for non-smokers.Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago looked at results from 22 studies conducted in the United States, Canada, Europe, India, Japan, and China. What they found -- and published in the American Journal of Public Health -- is a lung cancer risk 50 percent higher than normal for non-smokers exposed to smoke on the job for more than 30 years. They also found risk increases with level of exposure.\"We believe that our study provides the strongest evidence to date that smoking in the workplace does present a substantial risk to workers -- and particularly to workers who are working in highly exposed areas such as bar workers or restaurant workers,\" lead researcher Leslie Stayner said.Previous evidence for increased lung cancer risk caused by secondhand smoke comes from studies of non-smokers married to smokers.Secondhand smoke -- also known as passive smoke and environmental tobacco smoke -- is smoke from a cigarette, pipe, or cigar as well as smoke exhaled from the lungs of smokers and inhaled by non-smokers. It can cause cancer, respiratory problems, and asthma in non-smokers and is leading to increased efforts by communities to ban or limit smoking in the workplace. This week in France, bans begin in offices, stores, schools, and hospitals. Come January 2008, cafes and restaurants must also comply with bans. For now, smoking in these areas is permitted in hermetically sealed rooms without any services. Comments: ',\n",

       " 'Researchers have made a stem cell discovery that may help treat pancreatic cancer -- one of the deadliest forms of the disease. University of Michigan scientists have found cancer stem cells in pancreatic tumors that appear to drive cell tumor growth and could lead to the development of drugs to target and kill these cells.Pancreatic cancer kills 97 percent of people diagnosed with the disease within five years. Half of all diagnosed patients die within six months of diagnosis, and this cancer -- that spreads quickly and is rarely detected at an early state -- kills 33,000 each year in the United States alone. So any improvement in the study of this disease is a true gift.\"The clinical implications of this work are significant,\" said Dr. Diane Simeone, director of the Gastrointestinal Oncology Program at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Centre and lead author of the study, published in the journal Cancer Research. \"We\\'ve made baby steps in improving the survival in these patients -- on the order of a few months (longer to live) -- over the past decade or so. But we really haven\\'t had a major breakthrough in coming up with something that has the potential to provide a cure,\" she said.Simeone says killing these cancer stem cells is like pulling out the root of a weed. And she says the best way to pull out the root is to target these stem cells instead of the traditional approach of shrinking tumors by killing as many cells as possible -- an approach that may be flawed because cancer stem cells tend to resist standard therapies.

       " 'Cancer-related fear once consumed my mind. Now it sits lodged in the back of my brain and only presents itself on rare occasions. I handle my fears so much better now than when cancer was new and fresh and raw. My fears hardly ever cause me real anxiety, they don\\'t cripple my mental functioning anymore, and more than ever, they serve to focus my efforts in life. When fear strikes, it\\'s usually a wake-up call of sorts, a reminder to leave no stone unturned, a summons to keep on living.Although so much less threatening than they once were, my fears still exist. And I like to review them once in awhile, lose myself in a little emotional housekeeping, tidy up some of the mess cancer made. I always feel better when things are in order -- fears included.   I fear a breast cancer recurrence, the return of a tumor that rises to the   surface of my skin and presents itself again underneath my fingertips -- or in   my worst-case scenario is lost among dense breast tissue, undetected by   self-exam, and caught too late by some combination of mammogram, ultrasound,   and MRI.   I fear more than anything another cancer -- something entirely different   from breast cancer, something buried in my body and not as responsive as   breast cancer to treatment. I am prepared for a second visit from breast   cancer because I know how to proceed, know I will succumb to treatment that is   familiar, know I will remove both breasts in the most radical of life-saving   approaches. But cancer in my lungs, brain, bones, blood, ovaries is out of my   realm. And these cancers -- among many others -- really scare me.   I fear that my mom and my sister -- my first-degree female relatives --   will one day follow in my breast cancer footsteps. I once thought family   history trickled down from above, from older family members. Now I know the   disease can start with anyone. I am the anyone in my family. I am the   reason my mom and sister are closely watched and monitored and tested. I am   the one that put the fear of cancer into their hearts and minds -- and into   mine.   I fear having another baby. I fear the return of cancer during pregnancy,   leaving me with difficult choices regarding my health and my baby\\'s health. I   fear cancer returning after a baby is born, leaving me with one more child and   more treatment to manage. I fear another cancer would lead to a decreased   chance of survival and another baby would leave my husband feeling stranded   should I die too soon. And I fear having a baby girl who would inherit the   very real chance of developing breast cancer at some time during her   life.   I fear not having another baby. I fear the regret I may feel one day,   perhaps 50 years from now when I am healthy and cancer-free and without the   child I longed for. I fear I am being overly cautious, too tentative, a bit   selfish. A fellow cancer survivor once wrote me, \"I learned that my family   continues, even if I do not. I also learned that they are at least as tough as   I am so will cope with the genes I pass to them and their own cancer battles   if needed. Finally, I learned they look out for each other just as I looked   out for them. No matter what your future, you will never regret giving another   child a place in your family.\" I fear this man may be right.   I fear the potential long-term effects of treatment. I fear the   chemotherapy that saved my life in the short-term may come to haunt me in the   long run. I fear the radiation that zapped my breast and a piece of my lung   and part of my ribs and possibly my heart will cause me problems in the   future. I fear the effects of Herceptin -- the drug that dripped into my veins   for one whole year with the purpose of keeping cancer at bay -- and worry my   heart my fail me when I am old and gray because of the toxicity of this   drug.   I fear dying at a young age. I fear leaving my children before they are   grown. I fear leaving my husband a single parent, my mom someone who has lost   a child, and my sister an only child. I have been told over and over again   that my chances of survival are great, fantastic even. I have a 93 percent   chance of not dying from breast cancer. This does seem great -- until I take   into account that this percentage is good for only five years. My five years   will expire when I am 39 years old. What happens then, I am not sure. The only   thing I am sure about is that five years is not enough time. I want more, need   more, demand more. Yet I fear my days may be numbered.These are the fears that keep me focused. And while they are sometimes not-so-pleasant, I am in no hurry to resolve any of them. I am thankful really to have these fears swirling in my head -- because it means I am alive. And for me, being alive with fears is better than not being alive at all. Comments: 1.

The World Cancer Campaign slogan -- Today\\'s Children, Tomorrow\\'s World -- underscores the possibility that a concerted effort among world leaders, parents, and their children can make a real difference through four key actions -- providing a smoke-free environment for children; ensuring children keep physically active, eat a healthy diet, and avoid obesity; educating children about vaccines for virus-related liver and cervical cancers; and limiting children\\'s exposure to the sun.Former First Lady Barbara Bush, Her Royal Highness Lalla Slama of Morocco, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, and tennis star Steffi Graf are some of the powerful voices powering this campaign that UICC president Dr. Franco Cavalli says can save so many lives if embraced by those at the highest decision-making levels.\"Complacency and inaction on the part of world community will effectively contribute to more than 10 million deaths every year by 2020,\" he said.

And then something wonderful happened -- she realized she had stumbled upon a potential new method of attacking cancerous tumors that have become resistant to existing drugs.Schaefer and her colleagues at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York were testing a compound called a PPAR-gamma modulator -- a compound never considered a cancer drug, or a drug of any kind really -- when Schaefer made a calculation error and used a lot more of the compound than she should have. And her cells died.Upon further study, Schaefer found the compound killed just about every possible epithelial tumor cell. These cells line organs such as the colon and also the skin. The compound, that works like taxane drugs but without eventual tumor resistance, also killed colon tumors in mice without making them sick.The research team, whose findings are published in the journal International Cancer Research, plans more safety tests in mice.

       " 'If the experimental breast cancer drug Tykerb continues to prove successful in study participants, it could be headed for FDA approval.Tykerb, now in international study, showed in early studies to be even more effective and to have fewer side effects than similar breast cancer drug Herceptin. Both drugs are part of a cluster of targeted therapies that attack cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. Designed for use on women whose breast cancer is HER2 positive -- meaning it contains too much of an aggressive protein -- Tykerb may be a wonder drug, with the capability of effectively keeping breast cancer at bay.Dr. Paul Goss of MA General Hospital says, \"We\\'re seeing Tykerb, which is a pill, which is easier to take, has a broader attack and gets inside cells. It\\'s like an electrical circuit that\\'s turned on, and Tykerb can pull the lever, the circuit breaker, and switch it off.\" Comments: 1. This drug, also known as Lapatinib, amongst other names has been one of the better Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors out there, which blocks both the EGFR (ErbB1) and Her2(ErbB2) receptors, unlike Gefitinib (Iressa) which has been shown not to be as impressive in many types of cancers, including Breast, where EGFR and Her2 are known to be overexpressed. So, many companies including BMS, Array Pharmaceuticals etc have several \"broad range\" tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors in the pipeline. It all looks very promising. 2. Exciting results have come from studies of multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, \"small\" molecules that act on multiple receptors in the cancerous cells, like Tykerb and Sutent. The monoclonal antibodies like Herceptin and Erbitux are \"large\" molecules. These very large molecules don\\'t have a convenient way of getting access to the large majority of cells. Plus, there is multicellular resistance, the drugs affecting only the cells on the outside may not kill these cells if they are in contact with cells on the inside, which are protected from the drug. The cells may pass small molecules back and forth.Each of these new targeted drugs are not for everybody (just like conventional cancer drugs are not for everybody). Even when the disease is the same type, different patients\\' tumors respond differently to the same agents. As the saying goes, \"don\\'t throw out the baby with the bath water.\" If a drug works extremely well for only 10% of cancer patients, identify which 10%. If one drug or another is working for \"some\" people (not average populations), then obviously there are others out there who would also benefit.3. I am not sure that overexpression of a specific receptor (say ErbB1) would place a patient into a 10% category. These \"dirty\" inhibitors should have wider range of activity, since their specificities are nowhere near that of the antibody, which can be thwarted with polymorphisms etc, lowering the specificity, making antibody treatments more targeted and more specific. So, TKIs, as long as they target multiple pathways should find a wider patient pool, where they are effective.Dmitriy<A href=\"http://www.refuter.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.refuter.com/</A>4. Whether it be 10, 20 or 30%, the point is \"targeted drugs are not for everybody.\" Pre-tests, like the EGFRxâ\\x84¢ Assay, can help identify the individual cancer patient the drug works extremely well for, or it can tell that the drug is resistant. This could be Tykerb, Tarceva, Iressa, Sutent or Nexavar, because of being small molecule drugs. It is important to \"personalize\" cancer treatment, and this can be accomplished by \"testing the tumor first.\" 5. Is there any fresh new on Tykerb? I\\'ve been following the progress of this drug because I\\'m Her2 and hopeful of a treatment, this time, in the form of a Pill. When do you guys think it will become available for early stage breast cancer?6. Oh yea, here is a link to NEJM article that is very recent. <A href=\"http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/355/26/2733\" rel=nofollow>http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/355/26/2733</A>\"Conclusions Lapatinib plus capecitabine is superior to capecitabine alone in women with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer that has progressed after treatment with regimens that included an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab.

Is Tykerb FDA approved, and if not, where is it in the cycle? Thanks.9. FDA Approves Tykerb for Advanced Breast Cancer Patients<A href=\"http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/NEW01586.html\" rel=nofollow>http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/NEW01586.html</A>What is of particular note is that monoclonal antibodies (like Herceptin) are large molecules that attach to specific proteins on the outside of cancer cells and do not have a convenient way of getting access to a large majority of the targeted cells on the inside, which are protected from the drug. Plus, there is multicellular resistance, the drugs affecting only the cells on the outside may not kill these cells if they are in contact with cells on the inside. The cells may pass small molecules back and forth. This would be a very good reason Tykerb may be much better than Herceptin.10. greg, would it be totally unwise for someone with her2 stage2 breast cancer to just take Tykerb instead of Herceptin? I\\'m tantalized by the fact that it attacks small molecules, works even when herceptin stops working, and is in PILL FORM!11. Jeane. I thought about that myself. But the FDA says that Tykerb is only for Herceptin resistance. I have a lot of problem with that. The small vs large molecule may have some great significance. Targeted \"small-molecule\" therapies ruled at the last annual ASCO meeting of oncologists. The trend is away from the monoclonals to the small molecules.Having said that, the study of cell function analysis tells us that even when the disease is the same type, different patients\\' tumor respond differently to the same agents. Herceptin (or any other large molecule targeted drug) may be more beneficial to some patients than Tykerb, Sutent, or any other small molecule targeted drug.It\\'s ultimately up to the physician to get as much information he/she can get to come up with a rational decision. Gather up all the information you can research and present it to your physician. Diagnostic tests are just that, tests. Not treatment. A physician can use all the necessary diagnostic evaluations they can get.More and more physicians and patients are turning to individualized therapies to treat cancers. Without individualized testing, it\\'s difficult to determine which drugs are best for patients who don\\'t respond to standard therapies.12. A pretty good resource for some diverse information on cancer is this site:<A href=\"http://xooxleanswers.com/cancer.aspx\" rel=nofollow>http://xooxleanswers.com/cancer.aspx</A> from an online research service. It has links to an assortment of interesting research on breast cancer and other cancers -- causes, statistics, treatment -- and more links are added regularly. Hope it\\'s helpful. 13. Mr. Pawelski, please provide a link to this that you directly quote:\"Because Avastin is included with numerous drug cocktails, it costs $354,000 per year of life extended with Avastin because of today\\'s \\'cookie-cutter\\' approach to chemotherapy. You don\\'t know in advance who is going to respond.\"I\\'m especially interested the words that come after the word Avastin.I would be interested in knowing if the words after AVASTIN were added by someone other than the author of the quote to make a point. If I am off base on this one, I apologize.Thank you.14. Cancer Drugs\\' Spectacular Costs Shifting Market DynamicsTykerb (lapatinib) is one of the first oral agents with the potential to compete directly with the IV drugs which is both a high-volume and high-revenue part of office-based practices. Early use of Tykerb will likely be limited to patients whose breast cancer is refractory to Herceptin (trastuzumab). In the longer term, it could supplant or perhaps find a place in combination with Herceptin. Of course, will patients be able to afford the cost of these drugs? Herceptin\\'s wholesale price on an annualized basis is approximately $45,000 per year. Tarceva, $40,000 per year. Nexavar, $60,000 per year. Avastin, $47,000 per year. Will the price of Tykerb approximate these novel agents or exceed their costs? The problem is not unique to these drugs, but also to all of the new molecularly-targeted agents. Lee Newcomer, former chief medical officer and currently an executive with United Health Group, stated at the 12th annual conference of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, that \"Avastin improves outcomes in about 20% of patients, but we have no idea which cancer patients will benefit from a course of treatment. Because Avastin is included with numerous drug cocktails, it costs $354,000 per year of life extended with Avastin because of today\\'s \\'cookie-cutter\\' approach to chemotherapy. You don\\'t know in advance who is going to respond.\" Everyone is scared to death (and rightly so) at what is going to happen to the healthcare economic system with the introduction of increasingly expensive new drugs that benefit only a small percentage of patients who receive them, hence the headlong rush to develop tests to identify molecular predisposing mechanisms whose presence still does not guarantee that a drug will be effective for an individual patient. Nor can they, for any patient or even large group of patients, discriminate the potential for clinical activity among different agents of the same class. Profit is a powerful motivating force. Among medical benefit payors, the profit motive is entirely consistent with the goal of developing a molecular test, which is to identify efficacious therapies irrespective of drug mark-up rates. The FDA finds themselves under increasing pressure to allow new drugs into the marketplace, while at the same time protecting the safety of potential recipients of those drugs and also the financial interests of those who will have to pay for them. The pressure is so great that companion molecular diagnostics approved often have been mostly or totally ineffective at identifying clinical responders (durable and otherwise) to the various therapies. It should be in the FDA\\'s interest in saving the healthcare system perhaps billions of dollars a year (and thereby the healthcare system itself) by ensuring that expensive treatments are used appropriately. It should serve their interest not only in discovering new cancer treatments, but also using currently-available cell culture technologies to improve the effectiveness of existing drugs and save lives today by administering the right drug to the right patient at the right time. The methods of cancer medicine during the last thirty some years are coming to haunt the \"one-size-fits-all\" establishment. Technologies, developed over the last twenty years by private researchers, hold the key to solving some of the problems confronting a healthcare system that is seeking ways to best allocate available resources while accomplishing the critical task of matching individual patients with the treatments most likely to benefit them.15. Bigger guns than me are being aimed at the issue. United Healthcare has found some pretty disquieting things about the use of some big time biotech drugs. It\\'s former Chief Medical Officer and currently an executive with Minneapolis-based United Health Group (one of the leading medical insurers), Lee Newcomer, at the recent NCCN meeting cited a number of striking figures.<A href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/index.php?feed=Science&amp;article=UPI-1-20070316-20215500-bc-us-cancercosts-analysis.xml\" rel=nofollow>http://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/index.php?feed=Science&amp;article=UPI-1-20070316-20215500-bc-us-cancercosts-analysis.xml</A>',\n",
       " 'Women with early stage breast cancer now have a new tool at their disposal. The tool -- called MammaPrint -- is newly approved by the FDA and while it is not yet a perfect measure, it can be used along with other information to estimate whether breast cancer is likely to return in five or 10 years.The value of this test, that measures through computer analysis the activity of 70 genes using a sample of tissue removed from a breast tumor, is that doctors and patients can better determine course of treatments.MammoPrint offers two results -- high risk and low risk -- and accurately picked in studies which women were at low risk at least 90 percent of the time. However, for women who were told they were at high risk for recurrence as a result of the test, just 23 percent experienced a relapse.\"You can\\'t go all the way to the bank with this test,\" says FDA official Dr. Steven Gutman who argues the test is still better than having no information at all.Agendia, the Dutch maker of MammoPrint, is exploring ways to make this one-of-a-kind product available in the United States. It has been used in the Netherlands since 2005.\"This test has enormous implications for the short-term future of cancer research in general, and is one of the truly great breakthroughs of our time,\" says Cancer Blog reader Gregory Pawelski with whom I am grateful for sharing this story tip with me.  Comments: 1. Another new test, that looks at the expression of 70 genes linked to breast cancer, can accurately assess a patient\\'s risk of recurrence or death. The correlations of this are vastly superior to those obtained with standard prognostic markers.The 70 genes in a woman\\'s tumor analyzed by MammaPrint predict the 10-year survival of the patient at a significance level over three times greater than existing methods and with an accuracy level of 96.7% as determined by a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.Existing methods can\\'t distinguish the patients with a high risk for recurrence from those with low risk with comparable accuracy. This new gene expression profiling test enables the oncologist and breast surgeon to more accurately determine who should be treated.This test, and three other multi-gene tests have been shown to be superior over conventional assessment of risk of future metastatic disease, such as histological assessment of tumor aggressiveness (by grade). One gets more accurate information when using intact RNA isolated from \"fresh\" tissue than from using degraded RNA, which is present in paraffin-fixed tissues.This DNA microarray will prove to be highly complementary to the parellel breakthrough efforts in targeted therapy through cell culture tests like the EGFRxâ\\x84¢ Assay.',\n",

       " \"I will share anything and everything about my own experience with breast cancer -- how I found it, how it was removed, how it was treated, how I fared through the whole ordeal, how I'm surviving now.

So I am an open book. I talk about breast cancer, answer questions about breast cancer, and probably insert my opinion about the topic to some who don't really care. But I will continue talking and sharing -- and writing -- because the alternative would be a disservice to the few I may be able to help.

The slogan on it reads, Tell Someone and the illustrations on this card -- that functions as a postcard -- show women reaching out to other women. There are women talking on the phone and a woman tapping another on the shoulder. The message they appear to be spreading is highlighted in the text below the graphic representation of this campaign to raise awareness of cervical cancer. The message is about HPV -- human papillomavirus -- and about how millions of women already have it and how some don't even know they have it. I learned from reading this card that for some, HPV will clear on its own. But for some, cervical cancer may develop. This is why Pap tests are critical. And so what all women should be telling other women is this -- ask your doctor about the importance of Pap tests. And be active in your own health. And follow all recommendations for detecting health concerns early. I learned from reading this card that I should tell someone about this. And so now I have. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'Chemotherapy sent my blood counts spiraling on two separate occasions. Both times I landed in the hospital.

This was temporary and not such a big deal. What might be a big deal for breast cancer survivors like me, however, is the result of a new study suggesting there may be a risk of leukemia from these immunity boosting drugs.These drugs, G-CSF (such as Neupogen) and GM-CSF (such as Leukine) may cause rare cases of leukemia, says Columbia University\\'s Dawn Hersmand whose study is published in yesterday\\'s Journal of the National Cancer Institute.It\\'s already been established that chemotherapy itself can cause leukemia.

       " 'I never tire of cherishing the moment. Sometimes I get busy and distracted and caught up in the hustle and bustle of life, but I always come back to the simple appreciation of time. There\\'s no stopping it -- time -- and there\\'s no telling how my days will unfold as the seconds and minutes and hours tick by, so I try to live in the present with every breath I take.Cancer taught me this lesson -- this realization that time is not a guarantee, this deep-down feeling that I must soak up every experience that faces me. Each night when my husband and I check on our sleeping boys, we sigh with amazement and one of us religiously says something like, Wow, they are so great. We never want to lose sight of the joy these sometimes-challenging little people share with us. And so we watch them in their most peaceful moments, while emotion fills our heads and hearts.My husband has lost sight of his father -- literally. He died eight years ago today and while John can no longer see the man who passed away suddenly, without warning, and at a much-too-young age, his memories are still vivid. It\\'s the simple things he didn\\'t let slip by that are fresh in his mind today.John wrote this essay for his mom and two brothers and sent it to them today, in honor of his dad whose life he hopes will never escape him.And then there were fourI think about him just about every day. Most often it\\'s a song that reminds me of Dad, such as Cats in the Cradle, or even one of his favorite TV shows, Quantum Leap. I was shopping in Publix the other day while a great mix of music played -- a song from Three Degree\\'s came on, When Will I See You Again, and I stood there with a thousand-mile stare on my face as I thought of Dad. I work in a building that looks right across the street from the last residence hall I lived in, Yulee Hall -- the last dorm from which Dad muscled all my belongings. I see that building every day. The passing of time doesn\\'t fade the memories I have of him, the distance between the last one just increases. Just about this time eight years ago, I laid across Dad\\'s chest well after he took is last breath. That memory is forever burned into my mind along side the memory I have of walking past Kristin\\'s room that fateful day many years ago. Before that day there were six of us, then there were five, and now there are four.

Its Friday night almost midnight and I just read \"And then there were Four\". It is so beautiful and resonates with me deeply. Our family has been on this journey for almost a year (diagnosis February 27, 2006) and my mother and father are down the hall, hopefully asleep as my father valiently fights his battle with mesothelioma. This comparatively rare form of cancer is ugly and painful and has no cure as yet but we watch my 80 year old dad take his chemo, fight the side effects and try to make everyone else comfortable and happy. I cannot imagine what he is feeling and thinking other than the anger and resentment he feels toward those he holds somewhat responsible for this disease. As a young man - 16 years old, he left his family and joined the Navy to pay bills and fight for his country. He ended up working in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and on many ships and was exposed to many places and things - even clothing he was given to wear and products he had to work with that contained asbestos which was known even then to be a silent killer. His disease lay dormant for 40 or 50 years until he started developing symptoms which were not diagnosed until last year when it was too late for surgery but not too late thank goodness for him to fight. Men and women of the Greatest Generation as Tom Brokaw has so aptly designated them have not been protected or even acknowledged to have been exposed to this dreaded disease. As forms of cancers go, this is an orphan disease. I watch my father as he gets his chemo treatment and remember how I waited for him to get off the bus so my sister and I could run to him and he would pick us up in his arms after work. He was at every school function in my 19 years of education and he has watched the many accomplishments of his four grandchildren. He and my mother have been partners for 51 years next week. We are not ready to let him go. We pray that each scan shows improvement or stability. We pray for each good day he has. I cherish the fact that he and my mother have lived with us for the past year. We are truly blessed with the doctors we have found and all of the nurses and professionals we have come into contact with. We need to raise more awareness for this disease.

       " 'Environmental groups claim some children\\'s bath products contain a suspected cancer-causing chemical in amounts that reach or exceed safe limits. The chemical in question -- 1,4-dioxane -- is found in products made by companies such as Johnson and Johnson, Disney, Kimberly-Clark, and Gerber, says David Steinman, head of the environmental publishing company Freedom Press.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) calls this chemical, already known to cause cancer in animals, a probable human carcinogen. But there is no real regulation on the petroleum-derived chemical and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only recommends cosmetic companies limit the concentration of 1,4-dioxane to 10 parts per million (ppm). Studies show Johnson\\'s Kids Shampoo Watermelon Explosion contains the maximum recommended level of 10 ppm. They also reveal that Kid Care\\'s Hello Kitty Bubble Bath contains 12.3 ppm of the chemical. And two adult shampoos have been found to have twice the recommended level of this chemical that is typically a manufacturing by-product.It\\'s been reported that nearly 57 percent of all baby soaps contain 1,4-dioxane. But Iris Grossman, director of communications at Johnson and Johnson, stresses that all of her products are within FDA limits.Cancer is not the only risky link to children\\'s bath products. It seems these items are also linked to early puberty development. And this is concerning because a fast-paced growth rate combined with children\\'s porous skin increases susceptibility to toxins that can enter the bloodstream.

Over a million children are hospitalized because of poison and 250,000 go to the hospital because of it. Most of the checmicals can be cancer causing just like this blog is about. I myself had cancer when i was a child. I am in recovery or not but the doctors dont know why i had it. Cancer doesnt run genetically in my family.

It seems the more we look at the products we use routinely on our children, the more ugly truths we find. You can bet when I get home from work tonight, I am going to look through my child\\'s products to see if this is in anything we use on her. If it\\'s there, I\\'m throwing it out immediately. I refuse to expose my child to anything that\\'ll cause her more pain and suffering later on. Shame on these companies for using this ingredient in any product for children!4. as a child,my mother always gave me bubble baths.mr bubbles too be exact.and last year, i found out i had breat cancer. thanks for early detection,i was spared having my breast removed.i hope getting baths with mr bubbles didnt add to me getting cancer!5. Does anyone know what the 2 adult shampoos are that they mention in the article? Are possibly where I can get this info.? Thanks, Terri bobsterwells@aol.com6. It seems like a pretty big coincidence that the first two comments after the story for non-toxic, herbal bath products. Does anyone else think this is suspicious?7. let\\'s be realistic....two products that have close to the fda limit ( if those limits can be detected with any accuracy), then you add what one oz or 2 in a bath tub or for a baby, 10 gal.....presto way below the fda limit....let\\'s not get hysterical....ohhh by the way, the limits of that supposed cancer causing agent was calculated based on ingestion in rats, so make sure your child doesn\\'t drink the raw bubble bath.8. i cannot believe this !!! it infuraiates me to think that something so innocent as bubble bath is deadly to my child! this world is going to hell in a handbasket and it\\'s a sad state when i have to worry about not only murders and rapists who stalk our children but now in my own home there are things that i can\\'t control...makes me feel like pickin\\' up and movin\\' to a mountain and livin\\' of the land!9. Amen to the Melaleuca Products. I have been a happy, healthier customer for almost 4 years now. My son &amp; I have not visited a doctor in over 3 years because we fully converted to their products. How many wake up calls is it going to take for people to raise their voice and get manufacturers to change their ingredients?! We\\'ve known for years those products are dangerous, but we feel we have no way to change it. We do. Call on any of us in this Blog that work with Melaleuca. We can help you get started.PhyllisASherer@iglide.netwww.WorkAtHomeParent.biz10. <A href=\"http://www.safecosmetics.org/newsroom/press.cfm?pressReleaseID=21\" rel=nofollow>http://www.safecosmetics.org/newsroom/press.cfm?pressReleaseID=21</A> ... this links to the press release commented on in the above article. It specifically mentions the names of the children AND adult shampoos affected.11. sciencebiasis...you don\\'t have to drink a skin care product for it to be ingested by your body, Your skin will absorb anything liquid into it. That is why when a child is dehydrated they will tell you to put them in a bath tub. If you are exposed to the products over a number of years these chemicals will be introduced to your body at some point.12. Did you know picking your nose and scratching your butt causes cancer and leads to strokes also?13. With all due respect to Blake and Phyllis, Melaleuca is not for everyone! My mother was roped into selling it for a while, and I used some of the products. After an extremely bad allergic reaction to one of the products, I have never used them again. People who are allergic to trees, as I am, may want to think carefully before trying their products. As for being herbal, so is hemlock, which is deadly!14. I tried Melaleuca products. I didn\\'t like them at all. Each product had an awful smell. My family refused to use them! Though if we did use them I can I assure I would not allow my children to go 3 years without a doctor visit.There is going to be something unhealthy in just about any and everything you look close enough at. Too much stress can also cause illness in a perfectly healthy person. There\\'s no way we can stress over ever single study that is release. Tomorrow there will be another study canceling that one out. 15. ROTFL, Dan that\\'s absolutely perfect! If we looked into everything on the market and dissected it then everything we touch, use, and eat would probably have \"something\" in it that\\'s unsafe. Apparently having a cellphone causes brain cancer, yet I don\\'t see a decrease in that. People have survived much more harmful things than bubble baths. 16. Over a million children are hospitalized because of poison and 250,000 go to the hospital because of it.yeah. because that totally makes sense.17. I do remain pretty realistic, thank you. And realty is this, 1 or 2 oz. of this, just a little poison, 1 or 2 oz. of that, just a little more poison....and on and on. Add it all together and by lunch we\\'re in trouble! We should be made aware of all the things that are effecting us and try to eliminate or reduce the insults to our body as much as possible. The FDA is a joke. Why would food and drugs be linked together anyway? Big bucks thats why!18. p.s. thanks for the link Debra. I will check it out19. Melalucam however does contain teatree oil which has cause boys to develop breasts, it goes away when they discontinue use, but still.20. are you aware that childrens vitamins and other childrens products contain aspertame...aspertame is an extremely dangerous product, yet the makers of childrens vitamins use this because it tastes sweet and appeals to childrens palates..call up any manufacturer that makes childrens vitamins and they will verify my claim..i know i did and i was shocked by their response..the other names for aspertame are equal, nutrisweet, etc..not only are they putting aspertame in childrens vitamins, but in diet soda drinks, gum and other products..diet soda drinks are now being removed from schools in chicago, new mexico and other states and cities..save your children and yourselves, stop using these dangerous products, asap..',\n",
       " 'My nose was buried in books just after my breast cancer diagnosis. I craved information and thought the pursuit and acquisition of it would somehow help me gain control over a seemingly uncontrollable disease. For the most part, reading helps me. But sometimes, I read too much -- \"Stop reading\", my oncologist instructed me one day after I rambled off a bunch of worries I\\'d gathered from research -- and I\\'ve been known to get overwhelmed by statistics and numbers and theories and clinical jargon. When this happens, I usually find refuge in the personal stories of women living with breast cancer. Those who have weathered the cancer storm are often the real experts on cancer and know how to sift through the details, offering just what\\'s important to all who follow.For more than a decade, two-time breast cancer survivor Pat McRee searched for the perfect guide she could recommend for women she saw at the Flying Colors cancer resource and support center she directs. \"Too long,\" \"Too detailed,\" \"Overwhelming,\" \"Just plain scary,\" were the responses she heard about the books she had found. So she decided to think outside the book, to create her own support guide. An unbook is what she calls it. And it\\'s not too long, too detailed, too overwhelming, or too scary.Support to Go, The Unbook for the Journey through Breast Cancer is instead a compilation of survivor secrets, affirmations, inspiring quotations, poetry, song lyrics, attitude buttons, funny anecdotes, and referrals to expert resources in oncology, radiology, surgery, psychology, and complementary therapies.McRee considers her book a support group of sorts, a place where survivors can turn their wild rides into unforgettable journeys.

       " 'Luanne Austin says chemotherapy is not all it\\'s cracked up to be. She doesn\\'t mean it\\'s cracked up to be something really great but is far from such a thing. She means it\\'s cracked up to be something pretty horrible but is really not all that bad.Austin says the day her doctor announced she would receive chemotherapy was almost as bad as the day she learned she had breast cancer. That\\'s because she had heard nothing but bad things about the treatment. She expected to be laying in bed with her life in the balance -- nauseated, vomiting, sick -- as the \"cure\" killed her.All expectations aside, Austin decided to tackle chemotherapy with a positive attitude. This may seem a daunting task -- turning a dreaded chemotherapy protocol into a not-so-bad experience -- but Austin mastered the task. And here are seven of her positive thoughts about a treatment that is not all it\\'s cracked up to be.   Austin talked to people who had traveled journeys similar to hers. What   she learned is that many women continued working through treatment. Some   suffered very few side effects. One woman even told Austin her experience was   super. Austin was inspired by the positive women she tracked down.   And now she inspires others.   Austin did some reading. She learned that chemotherapy drugs target   quickly-dividing cells, like cancer cells, red and white blood cells, blood   platelets, and digestive tract cells. Learning about the process helped her   realize chemotherapy was intended to make her well, not make her suffer.    Austin learned how to support her body through treatment. She came to   understand that the best chance of surviving breast cancer comes from   conventional medicine -- surgery, chemotherapy, radiation -- but that   alternative treatments can complement the traditional approach. She recommends   the book Breast Cancer: Beyond Convention and considers her pursuit   of a healthy diet, exercise, supplements, and a good night\\'s sleep some of her   most helpful chemotherapy add-ons.   When Austin felt weak, tired, and just plain zoned out, she retreated to   her bed with a good book and a cup of tea. Instead of considering it a   setback, she called this downtime a good excuse to spend hours reading.    Austin found relief from her nurses. They were terrific, she recalls, and   professional and friendly and respectful too. Getting to know her medical crew   -- and receiving hugs from them at the end of her treatment -- confirmed   chemotherapy has some good points.   For Austin, God -- who carried her through her whole journey -- was   instrumental in her positive outlook. She felt lifted up and carried, she   says.   And then there\\'s love -- pure and simple love from her husband and family   members -- that allows her to conclude that chemotherapy is not so bad. \"I\\'d   have to say chemotherapy hasn\\'t been all that bad,\" she says. \"Not bad at   all.\" Comments: 1. Congratulations to Austin. She sounds strong and determined, that\\'s what it takes. I believe that everyone\\'s system is unique. Some of us are able to take chemo, radiation, without many side effects. Others, well, are not so lucky. One of my friends died of cancer 2 yrs ago. He was receiving radiation treatments to the throat. The side effects were horrid. After yrs of different treatments, the cancer did win. I can\\'t help but think had he taken a different path he might still be here. I have been offered Ribovirin &amp; Alpha Interferon, my own Dr said I would not be able to handle it physically. So, I am going on a special diet. Those are my choices.I am very happy for Austin, she too is unique. Someday, we will have a cure without having to worry about side effects. I do believe this is a persons biggest fear in fighting cancer; side effects from meds. But it is comforting if one has a loving family for support..Thanks for sharing. Jason ',\n",
       " 'Nearly 20 percent of women and eight percent of men with lung cancer have never smoked, say researchers involved in a study of one million people in the United States and Sweden. The likely culprit in these lung cancer cases is secondhand smoke.It\\'s not yet clear why women are more likely to develop the disease. Perhaps they are more susceptible to all forms of smoking -- whether direct or secondhand -- or maybe because more men smoke than women, women are more likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke.While smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, there are other factors to blame for disease incidence. Radon, asbestos, chromium, and arsenic are all associated with lung cancer.According to the American Cancer Society, lung cancer will be diagnosed in 213,000 Americans in 2007. The disease will kill 160,000. if(!CMSB_ID){var CMSB_ID=\"\"} CMSB_ID+=\"021007_MIDART_editorschoice,\";document.write(\\'<meta name=\"DCSext.rCMS\" content=\"\\' + CMSB_ID.substring(0,CMSB_ID.length - 1) + \\'\" />\\');  Comments: <SPAN id=ArticleBody_MoreLinksContainer></SPAN>1.

       " 'A lab in Oklahoma is studying genes for combinations that predict breast cancer risk. A look into the 100 genes gathered from each woman -- via mouthwash -- allows researchers to categorize women with standard, moderate, or high risks of developing the disease.The study begins with a lengthy questionnaire about medical history and leads to the collection of a DNA sample. Women simply rinse their mouths with a standard mouthwash and wait for results. Geneticist Dr. Kara Casas says she hopes that regardless of results, women will choose a healthy lifestyle with a diet low in fat and alcohol consumption and with lots of exercise too. But those in the moderate and high-risk groupings will be advised to make other lifestyle changes to help decrease their chances of getting breast cancer. They may be asked to regulate estrogen levels, for example, and to report regularly for mammograms at an earlier age.Casas says all women have some risk of developing breast cancer. But knowing what these risks are can help them better protect themselves -- which makes tests like this so important. A total of 12,000 samples will collected for an FDA trial.

       " \"I'm not much of a cook -- I don't like to cook, I don't cook well, and I am never really enticed to spend any amount of time in the kitchen preparing food. So my husband picks up my slack much of the time. Tonight he made turkey meatballs with rice and green peppers -- and some other veggie side dishes too -- and he cooks pasta and grills chicken and can successfully feed our family of four without hesitation or frustration. For me, cooking, hesitation, and frustration all roll into one. And that's why I avoid anything of the culinary persuasion and thank my lucky stars for a husband who doesn't mind cooking endeavors. But sometimes, I am forced to enter the kitchen -- I have two growing boys who need to eat, after all, and I am the one mostly at home catering to their every need. So I do okay -- I try to maintain a healthily family menu and I can handle the basics and no one is really complaining so I guess I'm holding my own. But I'd like to find more pleasure in cooking -- and more variety and more creativity too. Perhaps free weekly recipes sent to my e-mail inbox would be a push in the right direction. The American Institute for Cancer Research offers this service, and I am just moments away from subscribing to this offering that was started by a cancer group who sends out to anyone who signs up free recipes that are mostly lowfat, high-fiber, and plant-based. Launched just several months ago, this service already has more than 10,000 subscribers -- and many are cancer survivors who have learned to make everything from cherry spritzers to brown rice pudding to sweet potato and peanut chili. A name and e-mail address is all it takes to get the ball rolling -- just visit http://www.aicr.org/and look for the health-e-recipes area.&nbsp; Soon, simple and nutritious recipes will be at your fingertips.

       " 'I guess I\\'ve just assumed that breast cancer organizations happily accept every donation they receive and joyfully funnel all charitable gifts into their noble endeavors. I mean, without money and research and programs and services and education, where would we be? We\\'d be uninformed and lagging behind the force of this disease instead of gaining momentum on its trail. That\\'s where we\\'d be.Now, I\\'ve never assumed these organizations accept money obtained through illegal measures. But I\\'ve also never assumed they\\'d turn away money just because it came from a group of women whose profession and means of fundraising might be considered unacceptable. I suppose I shouldn\\'t make assumptions. Because I seem to be wrong on all accounts.The Breast Cancer Society of Canada has officially rejected a donation from a group of Vancouver strippers because of the controversial nature of their fundraisers. Exotic Dancers For Cancer these women call themselves, and for four years they have been raising money in honor of another dancer who lost her battle with terminal cancer.Trina Ricketts, founder of the exotic dancer website nakedtruth.ca and recipient of the letter rejecting the donation, is shocked that people consider this contribution dirty money. And she is so bothered by this unfair judgment that she has been contacting the media and outting the Breast Cancer Society of Canada\\'s discrimination practices. Her protests are working.In a supportive turn of events, Ricketts has been met with an overwhelmingly positive response -- and she now has several organizations willing to accept all donations she wishes to offer.This story is not nearly as simple as presented here. It\\'s so much more detailed and touching and moving when told by Ricketts herself -- who happens to share her inspiring journey right here.CORRECTION: Trina Ricketts reports that she did not seek out the media to out the Breast Cancer Society of Canada. \"The decision to go public was not in the interests of outing the Breast Cancer Society of Canada, but rather to seek out charities that would be willing to accept our donations,\" she said. Comments: 1. Hi Jacki, thank you for writing about this here. I just wanted to cliarify one thing. The decision to go public was not in the interests of outing the Breast Cancer Society of Canada, but rather to seek out charities that would be willing to accept our donations. The BCSC is not the only organization that has declined us. In fact, they were the first cancer-specific charity to not decline us, last year when we approached them for our third annual exotic dancers for cancer event. This year, we assumed they would take our donation again, but due to the flack they received after last year, they chose not to. Many of the org\\'s that are now coming forward publicly to say they\\'d accept our donation, have declined us in the past. So it is not an uncommon occurrence. The remarkable thing about all this is the opportunity it has provided the exotic dance community to challenge some of the stigma and stereotypes out there that we live with daily. I hope you and all those who read your blog will join us on the day of the event this year. It\\'s March 4 from 4pm till midnight at the Drake Showlounge in Vancouver. We will be deciding on a charity in next day or so. Thanks again for writing about our story. Trina xoxo2. It\\'s a shame that some organizations have an agenda that boils down to capricously choosing who benefits and who doesn\\'t based on a prejudice. What\\'s more innately immoral than denying a charitable impulse and refusing help for people in need? I\\'ll bet if you were to bypass the institutional gatekeepers and offer the money to an uninsured cancer patient who\\'s being told by his doctors to bug off because he can\\'t pay, he or she wouldn\\'t let any preconceived notions of \"morality\" keep him from gratefully using that money to survive. When I went through cancer without insurance, I doubt I would have questioned the character of someone who was offering me help in good faith. And guess what... the doctors certainly wouldn\\'t have cared where the money came from, as long as it ended up in their pockets.Best regards,Richard Day Gore3. Great idea, Richard! I\\'m currently uninsured and still in debt from my original diagnosis and surgery. I applied for medicaid but was denied twice. Since then, I applied for patient assistance programs and was accepted (thank goodness). I managed to get enough funding together for reconstruction but that eventually failed when I developed seromas that leaked. I got patched up three times from that but on my last visit to the surgeon, he said \"We can keep doing this but we\\'re not getting anywhere. It\\'s time for the expander to come out.\"Needless to say, I was devastated. Now, I face a lifetime carrying around one large, large breast which throws off my balance and affects my upper back quite a bit. I\\'m considering trying to get funding for another mastectomy just to even me up. Since I don\\'t have insurance, I have other medical needs that could use attention as well. However, I do now have a job that has doubled my income since my diagnosis but it is only part time and even with the improvement in my finances, there is no way in the world I could even get insurance, nevermind afford it. That leaves me with begging for every dollar for every procedure I have done...mammograms, blood work, dr. visits, etc. About the fund raising? It hurts me to know that these women have done the best they can to try to remember someone that was a part of their community and to help someone else with their efforts. It stinks.4. I encourage everyone to write a letter to the Breast Cancer Society of Canada. We can talk amongst ourselves but we are the \\'converted\\'. Let\\'s seize the opportunity to advocate for people who are stigmatized by our society. Below is a message that I sent to the Executive Director of the BCSC.Dear Ms XanthopouloI was greatly dismayed to hear that the Breast Cancer Society of Canada has made a decision to reject donations from the Exotic Dancers for Cancer. Stigmatization and discrimination seems to sadly be alive and well within an organization working to address a major health issue affecting Canadian women. ALL women are affected by this disease and ALL women must be shown respect regardless of their occupation. Your organization had an opportunity to educate corporate sponsors but unfortunately, you have dropped the ball on this issue. As an employee of a community-based organization, I encounter some of the most stigmatized people in our community. Society continues to marginalize particular segments of our communities and unless those of us in positions of support grasp the opportunities to advocate for change on behalf of the marginalized populations, nothing will change.It is never too late to reconsider poor decisions and judgments, Iâ\\x80\\x99m hoping the Breast Cancer Society of Canada will in fact reconsider this poor decision. I trust your response will show an indication of reconsideration.Debby Warren5. Ironic, considering a new ad campaign here in the States by the Susan G.

Speaking as a Ex-dancer and a daughter of a pancreatic cancer victim i feel as thought that any donation from any kind of career or profession should be taken . It pisses me off to think that someone would turn down a DONATION if it depended or contributed to more researh for cancer and a persons survial.8. MaryD,You are in my prayers. Medically-induced poverty is emotionally devastating, not to mention the physical hazards. Keep fighting.Love,Richard Day Gore9. I\\'d reject them, too. What they do is not respectful to the body or to women.10. Today was the first time I became aware of the Canadian Breast Cancer Societys\\' rejection of monies raised by a group of unselfish and empathetically motivated humanitarians such as the Exotic dancers.Had the donations been obtained by an illegal activity then perhaps I could understand, are we now going to judge people and thus deny them ,as in this instance, the privilege of aiding their fellow females. Are we not all sisters under the skin, are Exotic dancers exempt from Breast cancers ,were this so we should all aspire to be Exotic dancers.Let us remember that we are working for the greater good which is the eradication of Breast cancer.A Breast cancer survivor, Trudy Neilson11. do you know in Indonesia, there is a kind of onion name \"umbi danendra\" which used to kill cell cancer ? a lot of people already health from cancer and live without cancer because it works with burn the cell cancer and the methastase cell in the body of patient,so the people who has not the money come to traditional therapys and get health but the rich people come to doctor , take surgery,chemotherapy and die by cancer. i already see the people with stadium 4 breast cancer and the doctor said she will die soon but live health until now, people who get stadium 3 cervical cancer,already surgery for her uterus, ovarium, get health again after 1 month eat 3 umbi danendra per day.the cell cancer and the infiltrating cell has gone(MRI). and the cost only 300 usd, could you compare with the hospital cost? i believe with this onion because i already see the prove ,thats why i sell onion to everyone who need in this worldhope you are healthyichsan effendi12. I would like to see exotic dancers with one breast or none lost to cancer get up their and dance. Lets see how many men will acctualy pay to see these women dance for them and just how much money this women would make. Exotic dancers are viewed as the perfect body that every man desires. These women exploite female bodies for the pleasure of men and money. If you want to fund raise as a stripper keep your cloths on and then donate what you raise or as I suggested above get your one or no breasted strippers to raise the money. This might be more exceptible.Personal I do not think that anyone who exploites, degrades, dehumanizes or belives or participates in the degrading of women should be fund raising for this cause. That would be like excepting money form a child molester or rapest for fund raising for the victims of these crimes. Why don\\'t exotic dancers fund raise for their own cause I am sure their are a lot of ex dancers or existing dancers with problems that money would help. I do not mean to sound unfair but lets get real. ',\n",
       " 'I told my six-year-old son today that on Friday, we will attend a University of Florida gymnastics meet. Not such a big deal in and of itself but the fact that the entire meet is dedicated to the battle against breast cancer is what makes my announcement to Joey so important. You see, Joey has been my faithful companion ever since I was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago. He has been my link to all things simple. He has been my rock, my inspiration, my motivation to fight for my life.I told Joey this sports event is a celebration of people with breast cancer, like me. And I told him everyone must wear pink, a color he knows well when it\\'s twisted in ribbon formation. I eagerly awaited Joey\\'s reaction to the whole pink thing, not because he has an aversion to pink but because his absolute favorite color is orange and he tends to choose this fabric selection whenever possible. But without hesitation, Joey was completely accepting of making a pink fashion statement.I told Joey we would make shirts so we could be as pink as possible on Friday. So we bought white t-shirts and two shades of pink dye, and we will soon tie-dye our shirts for the festive occasion where both University of Florida and University of Kentucky gymnasts will wear pink leotards -- in different shades -- and where the fans will make donations to the local American Cancer Society.Joey asked me while we shopped for our t-shirt supplies if lots of people have cancer. \"Yes,\" I told him, recalling a fact I had just learned -- 8.9 million Americans alive today have a history of cancer. \"Lots of people have cancer.\"I am not sure what this means to Joey. But I suspect his comprehension of the disease is limited to pink ribbons, bald heads, and periodic celebrations. If only cancer were that simple.Cancer is not simple. But Joey helps me face each day with simplicity. And I can\\'t wait to simply make a few t-shirts with him and then pack the place pink in honor of all the women who every day face the complexities of a fierce opponent. Comments: ',\n",

And if you're like me and find big, swift, sweeping changes a sure recipe for defeat, then this short to-do list may seem a bit intimidating. So I'd like to offer a bit of my own advice for accomplishing these health feats -- take baby steps.Kristina has taken baby steps. She first quit smoking -- I'm not sure there's anything small about this success, however -- and now she's taking on membership at a gym. Cutting down on red wine comes next, she says, as she pursues a life driven by health.I have just recently taken a baby step myself. I stopped drinking soda -- or pop as I called it before relocating from Ohio to Florida. I'd known for some time I wanted to rid myself of the sugar that comes packaged in my favorite drinks -- Dr. Pepper and root beer -- but for some reason, I was dragging my feet when it came to giving up this vice. Yet I did it. I stopped drinking soda, replaced it with water, and now have no desire for sugary drinks of any kind.I am a creature of habit. I know this because I spent years drinking only water. But when cancer struck, I turned to the carbonation of soft drinks to settle my upset stomach. With time, my stomach stopped bothering me. But I didn't stop drinking soda. I kept drinking it for no other reason than pure habit. And when I convinced myself this practice was not necessary in my life, I cut it out.Perhaps I'll tackle chocolate next. Or exercising more. Who knows. I'm just happy I accomplished one small task. And I hope you'll consider taking baby steps in your pursuits for better health. Just remember, we didn't hop up one day and start sprinting in infancy. It took years to fine-tune our ability to run on our own. And it may take years to carve out a healthful way of living. Comments: 1. I simply wanted to say Thank you to all Bloggers. For you to take time out of your day to help others, is a very unselfish act. Having gone through physical tests yourselves, and being 1st and 2nd time survivors of cancer and other diseases, has obviously driven you. You have much strength and desire to reach out, open doors for people to communicate to each other. Without you, what would we do? I have met a few people with these same qualities, few and far between. So, I have the utmost respect and admiration for each and every one of you, your knowledge, ability to share and care for perfect strangers, again, is such an unselfish act.You are number one in my book. Thanks to all, peace, love, and good health to everyone. Take care, Sincerely, Jasonp.s. This is one of my bad nights, writing and sharing seems to take my mind off of my own physical problems. Thank you for alowing me to write at any time. JC\",\n",
       " \"United States Representative Charles Norwood, who left Washington last week to enter into the care of hospice, died yesterday at his home after battling cancer and lung disease. He was 65.Norwood, whose passing prompted the House to observe a moment of silence Tuesday in his honor, suffered since 1998 from chronic lung disease and later metastatic cancer that spread from his lungs to his liver. Last week, he announced he would no longer accept treatment, that he would allow hospice to care for him for the remainder of his days.A dentist from Augusta, Georgia, Norwood was the first Republican to represent northeastern Georgia since the Civil War. A conservative passionately opposed to government bureaucracy and adamantly supportive of patients' rights, he hoped to one day become Georgia's first Republican Governor.Norwood's medical decline began when his lung condition -- idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis -- began restricting his ability to breathe and necessitated a lung transplant in 2004. Known for zipping around the Capitol with a motorized cart and oxygen tank, Norwood developed cancer on his non-transplanted lung reportedly due to the immune suppression drugs he took after his transplant. And although his cancer was surgically removed and his health did improve, doctors learned this past November his cancer had spread.The vacancy left by Norwood's death will not be filled immediately due to governmental process. In Georgia, within 10 days of the seat being vacated, the governor must request a special election to the secretary of state. And the election must be held no fewer than 30 days later.Norwood is survived by his wife, Gloria; two sons, Charles and Carlton; and four grandchildren. Comments: \",\n",

And today, February 14 -- a day reserved for all things love inspired -- you are invited to take part in a live Kansas City, Missouri benefit in honor of this lovely woman.Join the live webcast of Film Clips -- a celebration of Mairtin de Cogain's soon-to-be-released American film The Wind That Shakes The Barley. Not only a celebration of film, this event will also feature the clipping of every strand of Mairtin de Cogain's hair -- and beard too. Attendees can claim a lock with a donation of $10 that will head straight to the Jennifer Ireland Fund. It all happens between the hours of 11:00 and 2:00 PM on this St. Valentine's Day.There is so much more to say about Jennifer -- and she and her husband powerfully say it all on the blog they authored throughout their harrowing yet moving journey. Comments: 1. My response can only be, I am so sorry for the loss of Jennifer, loving mother and wife. What a great loss to her family and friends. I thank God we are blessed with memories. When our loved one's are taken by cancer, that is all that is left, wonferful memories in pictures, our hearts, and in our minds, they will always be alive. That is the one thing that cancer can not take away. It has no feelings of love, compassion, or respect for life. Cancer only knows ATTACK! Age, color, or what your gender is, doesn't seem to make a difference. But your memeories are yours to keep forever and a day. My deepest sympathy to family. And to all those who have lost a loved one on this day of Valentines, be assured that Jennifer is looking over you, her children, and all those whose lives she has touched with her loving heart, and her warm feelings.With much love to all, take care, and know that she is there.

       " 'According to the results of an international study, postmenopausal women who have taken tamoxifen for early stage estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer for two to three years might increase their chances of survival by switching to newer breast cancer drugs called aromatase inhibitors.Study researchers found this drug switch-up reduced the number of events linked to poor survival by 32 percent -- although no difference has been found in overall survival at this early point in the trial.\"These findings provide some limited evidence to advise all women being administered tamoxifen to switch, even though this approach is not devoid of potentially serious side effects,\" say experts at the National Cancer Institute.Side effects appear to be minimal, however, and the up side of treatment with aromatase inhibitors is the fact that they don\\'t seem to carry the risk of death from other causes like with tamoxifen, which can cause stroke or endometrial cancer. This study is expected to be published in the March 15 issue of the journal Cancer. Comments: ',\n",
       " \"I'm just waiting for the call -- the call that prompts my first visit with any number of newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients who want someone to lend an ear, a shoulder, and a few good tips for steering through a scary journey.I am a new American Cancer Society Reach to Recovery volunteer, trained this past Saturday and ready to help others who are slipping into the shoes I started wearing two years ago. I was first a recipient of this program -- designed to match new breast cancer patients with veteran survivors through face-to-face visits -- and I know well the comfort that comes from the support of someone not so overwhelmed by cancer. So now it's my turn to offer the comfort. And I am oh so ready.I am armed with literature, communication techniques, gift bags for my patients, and my own official volunteer pin. And while I am a bit anxious about how my first meeting will go, I learned on Saturday that my mere presence will be enough to calm the women whose lives I am about to touch.There is no better vision for someone just diagnosed with breast cancer than a healthy, happy woman who happens to be surviving the same disease. And so it is hope that I will spread and my unspoken portrayal of life after cancer that will inspire these women. My words will be icing on the cake. It's me these women want to see. And it's these women I want to see as I begin to reach to recovery -- a recovery I suspect will largely be my own. Comments: 1. You will be an inspiration to these women. I know that your words have comforted me for many months, since I was diagnosed last April. I found your personal blog by accident and then this one. You are right, for those of us newly diagnosed there is nothing more comforting than talking to someone who has been through it and made it. And for those of us who don't do well with group therapy, one on one may be just the ticket - even if it's just reading another's blog entries. You are an inspiration Jackie and I thank-you.\",\n",
       " \"The first documented whole-ovary transplants are now on the map -- the United States map.On February 5, a renowned infertility expert in St. Louis transplanted a whole ovary from one woman into her sister in order to enable the sibling to have children after a battle with ovarian cancer that resulted in early and permanent menopause.Dr. Sherman Silber, who performed the same type of transplant on twins last month and has previously restored fertility via ovary tissue transplants, believes his success is unmatched. Apparently, surgeons in China have reported similar success but offer few details to support their claim. And due to a lack of published material about the case, it is believed Dr. Silber's ovary transplants may be the world's first scientifically documented cases.Silber says whole-ovary transplants, that could potentially allow women with cancer to freeze an ovary, undergo treatment, and then have the ovary returned to restore fertility, could also one day help women who don't have cancer but experience natural premature ovarian failure, which leads to early menopause.While both of Silber's ovary transplant patients are awaiting news about their status of their fertility, Silber awaits the long-term results of his work. Ovarian tissue transplants last a few years, but whole ovary transplants should last for decades, he says. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'Scientists have uncovered a gene they say may be cancer\\'s master switch. Like a circuit breast of sorts, the newly identified gene, CHD5, has an important job -- it\\'s a tumor suppressor that prevents cancer from developing. But when it slacks on its job, cells begin to misbehave and tumors can form. One professor of genetics says the gene, located on chromosome 1, governs the activity of a wide array of other genes involved in tumor-suppression. Its reach is large. And the implications of improper functioning are significant.Cancers associated with the malfunctioning gene include brain tumors such as gliomas and breast, ovarian, prostate, and colorectal cancers.A lot of people have been looking for this gene for decades. And now that it\\'s been located, it will influence cancer research for years to come. The discovery will provide valuable new insight into targeted drugs and diagnostics and will turn up patients who need more aggressive treatment.\"We are really excited about our discovery,\" says the lead investigator of the research, which is published in the journal Nature. Comments: 1. Thank you, researchers, for finding this small ray of hope. I lost a little girl to a brain tumor in 1991. She\\'s looking over your work and giving it God\\'s blessing.',\n",
       " 'Scientists say drivers who spend a lot of time in the car have an increased chance of developing cancer.It\\'s the exposure to the sun\\'s rays through car windows that hikes the risk of skin cancer, especially for those who drive with open windows.In a study of 898 patients with skin cancer, it was discovered that the disease spread to the part of the body closest to the side car window. In response to this finding, doctors recommend drivers tint their car windows or use ultraviolet filters in an effort to minimize cancer risk. Comments: 1. No matter what steps are taken to reduce sun exposure it is still important to carefully examine your skin for suspicious moles that could portend a deadly melanoma. The traditional ABCD criteria can help guide risk assessment. A, for asymmetric lesions; B for moles with irregular Borders; C, for colors in the lesion; and D, for diameter greater than the tip of an eraser. More recently physicians have recognized the importance of moles that are new or getting larger in predicting high risk lesions. They have now added E for enlargement to the criteria and many recommend following the ABCDEâ\\x80\\x99s.Although dermatologists almost always ask if you have any new or changing moles most people cannot accurately answer that question (particularly those with numerous moles and the greatest risk). One way to approach this problem is to use Total Body Photography to document the moles on your body. However, this is an expensive procedure (often costing $400-$600) that most insurance providers will not cover.There is now an inexpensive software program that allows people to use their own digital cameras at home to take their own body images at different time intervals (maximizing privacy). The images can be scaled and aligned and compared using a personal computer to allow for the efficient recognition of new or growing moles. This software was developed from funding provided by the National Cancer Institute and can be obtained by going to the website <A href=\"http://www.dermalert.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.dermalert.com/</A> .',\n",
       " 'My friend called me last night as she was having a miscarriage. She had been to the doctor, heard no heartbeat, and learned via ultrasound that her baby had stopped thriving weeks ago. Her doctors told her what to expect -- bleeding and cramping and contractions and possibly a D &amp; C -- and she was experiencing some of these inevitable symptoms as we spoke on the phone. My friend called me because the same thing happened to me six years ago -- and when she remembered this, she dialed the phone from a state thousands of miles away. And despite our distance, our connection was close enough for comfort. There are some differences in our circumstances. I had no children at the time of my miscarriage and my friend has two. I was younger than her at the time of my tragedy and knew I would go on to have children while she questions her age and worries about the viability of any pregnancy after this one. But there are many similarities -- and this is what makes for powerful connections and powerful healing. We both lost our babies at the same stage of pregnancy -- at about 10 weeks -- and our fetuses had not grown beyond the same point -- about five or six weeks. Our symptoms were largely the same, our sadness is alike, our grief is sadly overwhelming and deafening. But this crushing blow that we both have experienced brings us together -- and I hope that my friend is soothed by the fact that she is not alone.This one fact -- that I am not alone -- is what has powered me along on my breast cancer journey without too many diversions and breakdowns. I am not alone on my cancer travels and this makes me feel safe, comforted, at ease. I am also not alone as a mom, a preschool teacher, a writer -- and a survivor of miscarriage. I lean on others in all areas of my life. I absorb their advice and knowledge and direction so that I can heal as a mom of two challenging boys, a one-time overwhelmed teacher, a writer trying to express clear and concise messages. And a survivor of miscarriage.My own advice and knowledge and direction for my friend is this -- keep talking and sharing and reaching and connecting. What one cannot do alone, two -- or three or four or more -- can surely accomplish. I know this is true. Comments: 1. This was inspiring. Your friend is blessed to have you in her life. God Bless you both.',\n",
       " 'Cancer drug Nexavar has made its point. It can help people with liver cancer survive longer.Bayer Pharmaceuticals and Onyx Pharmaceuticals announced Monday that advanced stage clinical trials for this drug will end early. And now patients in the placebo arm of the study can begin treatment with the actual drug.It\\'s been a long road for researchers who have been searching for a liver cancer treatment that can target tumors with minimal side effects while extending life for months or even years. It is estimated that 16,780 people in the United States will die from liver cancer in 2007 -- and it seems Nexavar, a drug initially predicted to fail when used for liver cancer -- may help save some of these lives.Bayer and Onyx are planning to pursue FDA approval for this drug that has already been approved for kidney cancer. Comments: 1. Do Targeted Cancer Drugs Always Work?The \"targets\" that the new \"smart drugs\" go after can be located on the \"inside\" or \"outside\" of a cancer cell. The most common targets on the outside are receptors, proteins that help relay chemical messages. And many targets on the inside are enzymes, proteins that help speed up chemical reactions in the body.What Nexavar, Iressa, Tarceva, Sutent and Tykerb have in common is that they are small molecule drugs. Exciting results have come from studies of multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, small molecules that act on multiple receptors in the cancerous cells.Cells are the most basic structure of the body. Cells make up tissues, and tissues make up organs, such as the lungs or liver. Each cell is surrounded by a membrane, a thin layer that separates the outside of the cell from the inside.For a cell to perform necessary functions for the body and respond to its surroundings, it needs to communicate with other cells in the body. Communication occurs through chemical messages in a process called signal transduction. The purpose of these signals is to tell the cell what to do, such as when to grow, divide into two new cells, and die.Targeted cancer therapies use drugs that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific molecules involved in carcinogenesis (the process by which normal cells become cancer cells) and tumor growth. By focusing on molecular and cellular changes that are specific to cancer, targeted cancer therapies may be more effective than current treatments and less harmful to normal cells.However, monoclonal antibodies are \"large\" molecules. These very large molecules don\\'t have a convenient way of getting access to the large majority of cells. Plus, there is multicellular resistance, the drugs affecting only the cells on the outside may not kill these cells if they are in contact with cells on the inside, which are protected from the drug. The cells may pass small molecules back and forth.Even if clinical trials end early, each of these new targeted drugs are not for everybody. The study of cell function analysis tells us that even when the disease is the same type, different patients\\' tumors respond differently to the same agents. So it doesn\\'t matter if there is a \"target\" molecule in the cell that the \"targeted\" drug is going after, if the drug either won\\'t \"get in\" in the first place or if it gets pumped out/extruded or if it gets immediately metabolized inside the cell, drug resistance is multifactorial. 2. Practically all of the money that is being spent is on TREATMENT of cancer. We have been going down this road since Richard Nixon with no answer for TREATMENT. Isn\\'t it over due to change course and focus on PREVENTION. None of these drugs are going to prevent cancer in the first place. So the drug companies continue to crank out the latest billion dollar treatment to help someone live weeks, months or years longer. Listen to the advertisements for TREATMENTS for this and TREATMENTS FOR THAT. The food industry pulls you into sickness with these ads and the drug advertising industry says that now you are sick let us treat you. These ads are running back to back. There is no money for the drug manufactures in PREVENTION. Isn\\'t it ovious why they dont want to concentrate on Prevention. Eliminating so called man made or modified food, and all chemicals that man makes for the food industry that is not suppost to be eaten by anyone or puting it on their skin or breathing it. Every concentrate that man has extracted from food he modifies it so that it is no longer fit to eat. Sugar, oils, grains, meat and the list goes on and on. Animals, (man also), was simply not meant to consume these things made or modified by man. Eat only those things that nature, or call it God if you like, put on this earth for us to eat. The rate of cancer and many other diseases like obesity, diabetes high blood pressure, and you name it would simply go away for most of the people. Now you know why I will not WALK for TREATMENT of cancer. Why put more money into a failed approach. I will walk for Prevention. Cancer SurvivorBill3. I think this is great news! It is true that certain individuals will respond to Nexavar an unusual way.Some people are bound to have more side effects than others. Maybe this drug will only help a selected few, even if it is only 100 out of , let\\'s say, a 1000, that is 100 people that will have a few more months or years to be with their family and friends, how wonderful for them. They can watch the sun, rise and set, longer than expected.So, to those of you who are willing and able to give Nexavar a chance, good luck, think positive, and know that our researchers are in your corner. Congrats to research, they have done it again!Thank you, GOOD LUCK to all. Jason4. Well the researchers need to be congratulated ! It is one thing trying to prevent the disease, and it is another thing trying to look for medication for the disease. whether we like it or not, be it with genetically modified food or with not, the disease will be there and will continue to be there for the years to come, because there are quite a lot of causes, known orprobalily unknown, that result in on having the disease.Naxabar is a HOPE for, not only an advanced patient cancer, but also for those families and friends who care for the patients. I wish to raise a very important issue here, affordability. Just like the case of HIV/AIDS, major donors should find a way of trying to save the livews of people who are on supportive care, but can not afford to buy the medicines. 5. Dose any one know when I can buy this medicine? My uncle, who had a liver cancer, want to try this drug. However, he is not in USA now. 6.

       " 'A friend of mine with breast cancer just sent out an update e-mail to friends and family. She began her message with an apology for her recent lack of communication. But she assured us all that she\\'s been out of the loop not because she\\'s felt sick or tired. It\\'s because she\\'s been too busy with normal life. And that\\'s a good thing, she says.This friend wasn\\'t so sure how she would fare -- both physically and emotionally -- when she was first diagnosed with cancer. But she seems to have done a champion\\'s job of rolling with the punches. Sure, she\\'s had ups and downs. But she is overwhelmingly positive and hopeful. And jumping off my computer screen as I read her e-mail were at least seven bits of hope that tell me she is doing just fine despite all that is unbelievably hard about breast cancer.My friend just had her first infusion of Taxol. A breeze, she calls it. One. So easy on her body -- two -- that she headed right out and took her daughter communion dress shopping. Her little love looked beautiful, she wrote. Like a mini-bride. The mother of the mini-bride then -- three -- turned a sad moment into a comforting one when her daughter asked, \"Mommy, who do you think will bring me wedding dress shopping?\" \"Me of course, why?\" responded my friend.\"Well, you know, if that thing that we don\\'t want to happen happens and you die, then who would bring me wedding dress shopping?\" this little girl asked her mom.Holding back tears, mom reassured daughter she would definitely be the one taking her wedding dress shopping. She\\'d be dancing at her wedding too, she declared.My friend also shared in her correspondence -- four -- that she plans to walk, and maybe run, in her local American Cancer Society Relay for Life event in April. And she has already rallied a bunch of support -- five -- and is thrilled to have a group of co-workers, and even the principal at her school, forming a team in her honor.\"I am so lucky to have such a wonderful school family,\" wrote my friend who plans to raise oodles of hope -- six -- when she begins collecting funds for Relay for Life.What inspires me most about my friend\\'s e-mail is the light and happy manner in which she spouts off all the good in her life -- seven -- when there is so much at this very moment that is downright difficult, like entire days spent in an infusion room, plummeting red blood cells, aching bones and joints, and tingly fingers and toes.I think my friend knows this phase of her life is temporary, that she will overcome all obstacles, that she will really fare just fine both physically and mentally throughout this ordeal. And this must be what powers her through the days she amazingly calls -- normal.  Comments: 1. I am so glad that I came across your entry, it helps to boost my confidence in beginning my chemotherapy. I start my chemo on the 28th of Feb.

       " 'Recent news reports reveal Britney Spears recently checked in and then checked right out of Eric Clapton\\'s Crossroads Centre rehab facility in Antigua. And now that Spears has returned to Los Angeles, something else is being revealed -- her bald head.Apparently Spears chose to shave her head and add a few new tattoos to her body in honor of her speedy return back home. Why, I am not sure. But the image of her shiny scalp brings back bitter memories of my own bald head that had nothing to do with free will and choice and had everything to do with cancer.I hated my bald head, took great pains to cover it at all times, and found nothing beautiful about the prominent display of flesh that surrounded my face. I can see beauty in other bald heads -- and I think Britney looks just fine with her new look -- but I was blind to it when looking at myself in the mirror. I hated my bald head.\"What are you going to do with your hair?\" one of my co-workers asked me the other day. \"I\\'m letting it grow,\" I told her. \"And grow and grow and grow,\" I thought to myself.This co-worker seemed sad I was growing my hair. She said she really liked it short, with its tight curls and flat-to-my-head style. Many people have told me this same thing, that I look good with short hair. And maybe I do. Maybe I look good bald too. But I never wished for short hair. I never wished for no hair. And so I am getting back at cancer by letting my hair grow and grow and grow. It\\'s my revenge of sorts. Bald is just not for me. So I\\'m relinquishing all rights I have to this extreme hair fashion to those who choose it. To those who wear it well. To Britney. Comments: 1. I would hope others might look back at their bald heads as beautiful evidence that chemotherapy succeeded in killing off fast rapidly dividing cells both hair and cancer.I say, thank goodness for chemotherapy. Thank goodness for bald heads.2. someone should take her and beat her ass for shaving her head a lot of kids that have to have there shaved of for medical reasons dont have a choice to save there hair she is just a spoiled brat now3. It seems to me that Britney feels a need to be the center of attention, all focus on her, not caring or being concerned of how this might effect those who have lost their hair due to chemo. I feel sorry for her that she is so insensitive to others. How lonely she must be.I once shaved my head, it was for my friend who lost her hair to chemo. Mine grew back, hers did not, as she lost her battle with cancer.So, to those who are going bald due to natural causes, be thankful.Jacki, take your revenge, and grow, and grow, your hair as long as you want to. You\\'ve earned it!Sincerely, Jason 4. She has no dignity when it comes to who she wants to be. She is failing and her limelight is quickly fading and a stunt like this only brightens the light for a short time. She will fade as a pop star soon enough. Where are her kids thru all of this? Gwen Stefani always has her child with her but not Britney. Maybe she should have practiced safe sex b/c a mother she is not.5. What\\'s wrong with a girl shaving her head? Cancer is not the only reason women shave. Some are in the military. Others just like the look. No woman, whetehr bald by choice or by chemo, should ever ever feel ashamed. We are certainly so very much more than our flowing locks. It is pure sexism to degrade a bald woman\\'s beauty. 6. Video is at <A href=\"http://www.britneyshaved.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.britneyshaved.com/</A>7. I THINK SHE TRYING CHANGE AND REGROUP HER LIFE AND TO MOVE ON......8. i think its very clever ploy and i think she is making a wonderful statement......easy maintenance also....heave the wig9. Britney shaved head has absolutely nothing to do with cancer patients. I think it\\'s absolutely hideous to claim its disrepecting cancer patients and that she\\'s being inconsiderate. I think its a very lame thing to save. I feel she is going through some personal issues and she should be kept in a rehab. but she is not to be blamed because she shaved her head. people shave their heads all the time for different reasons. It does NOT give anyone the right to judge her. I believe that Kevin has most def. has been a complication to her life. and he was a very poor choice for her to be involved with. but you can\\'t dwell on the past. Hopefully she will learn &amp; try to get her life in line once again. 10. Britney did this for publicly. Not because there is something wrong with her. she should be careful thou she may end up like Anna nicole smith, Too much Publicly will make you bitter because the public will pick you apart untill there\\'s nothing left but hate and anger. 11. I am a breast cancer survivor. I lost my hair to chemo. I did not choose this. It was like an added punishment for having this disease. It was devestating to me to loose my hair. Britney should be more sensitive to the fact that what she is doing effects more than just her fans...I find it offensive.12. When I saw this, I had just lost my hair for the second time. This time it was due to whole head radiation due to mets breast cancer. The first time I lost my hair to chemo, I was prepared and okay with it. I was told about my hair this time around after they had already started treatment for the tumors in my brain. I wasn\\'t prepared and my hair was it\\'s longest yet after two years of growing back. The comments I disliked the most was \"oh YOU are going with the Britney look\". Uh NO For whatever reason she did it, the locks should have been donated to locks for love. That would have probably made it more \"okay\" for me.13. Here\\'s what my wife and I have to say about Britney, baldness, and chemo...<A href=\"http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-myturn19mar19,1,897032.story\" rel=nofollow>http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-myturn19mar19,1,897032.story</A>14. Many women in recent years shave their heads and wear what they refer to in the fashion industry as \"the bald look\". It is just a fashion style for women, just like a pixie, a bob style or whatever. It is not considered unhealthy or an insult to anyone. It has become a fashion style for some women.A number of women fashion models in recent years have modeled with bald heads, either because they are bald with alopecia or shave their heads.Some women look beautiful, sensual, and exotic with bald heads. You can really see their feminine features without hair in the way.The bald look can look good on some beautiful women, especially if they are dressed feminine in a beautiful dress, makeup, long dangle earrings, etc..15. I read Brittany was unable to donate her hair to Locks of Love (or anybody else) because it was so over-processed.Maybe she just needed to start over fresh!',\n",

The cause of death -- cancer.Bauer, who managed the 1966 Baltimore Orioles to their first World Series title, was a three-time All-Star Yankees outfielder during his time with the team that won nine American League pennants and seven World Series titles in just 10 years. Bauer, a Yankees fixture from 1948-59, set the Series record with a 17-game hitting streak. His record still stands.Yankees owner George Steinbrenner says, \"Hank Bauer is an emblem of a generation that helped shape the landscape of our country.

He also earned two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts for his courageous dedication to the United States.Enlisting in the Marines shortly after Pearl Harbor, Bauer was wounded in Okinawa when he was hit in the leg by shrapnel just 53 days after he arrived on the island with 64 other men. \"Only six of us came out,\" said Bauer who signed with the Yankees minor league after his discharge and sported his Marine Corps crewcut throughout the baseball career that landed him with the likes of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and a young Roger Maris.During the same week Bauer lost his life, two other players of his time also passed away -- Steve Barber, who pitched for Bauer in Baltimore and Lew Burdette, who played against the Yankees in the 1957 and 1958 World Series.Bauer is remembered by many.\"I am truly heartbroken,\" says Berra. \"Hank was a wonderful teammate and friend for so long. Nobody was more dedicated and proud to be a Yankee, he gave you everything he had.\" Comments: ',\n",

       " 'I like to exercise. I like the challenge, the sweat, the mental release, the physical results, the time to myself. I like everything about it -- practically.What I don\\'t like about exercise is the pressure to accomplish the feat over and over again for the rest of my life. For years, the pressure I put on myself was palpable. I thought about exercise all the time. I stressed about what to do and when to do it. I fought to convince my kids to climb into a double stroller long after they were too big to sit comfortably in the wobbly contraption and when I found time to exercise all by myself, I struggled with an overwhelming desire to spend quality time with my little boys. I felt rushed to complete my workouts -- because my kids were waiting, dinner was waiting, work was waiting.I was faithful about exercising -- even through treatment for cancer -- because of my self-induced pressure and despite the stress and worry it caused me. And then something happened.It was probably a combination of cancer and my relentless push for physical fitness that caused my body to crash. I became tired and exhausted and could barely lift my legs to walk up the neighborhood hills I typically conquered with ease. My oncologist told me to stop, to give my body a break, to let go of my high expectations. He advised me to exercise two to three times per week -- and that\\'s it. It took some time but I have finally embraced this approach. I have abandoned schedules and routines and plans and I now exercise when I can, when it fits into my day, when I really want to do it. My fitness trainer friend Fitz, a new blogger on That\\'s Fit, wrote in one of her first posts that we should all stop trying to get fit -- and we should just do it. \"Don\\'t wake up tomorrow with the idea of trying to go for a jog,\" she says.\" \"Get up and go for a jog! Put it in your planner and make it happen.\"Fitz might not like my approach, but I have stopped putting exercise on my planner. For me, this works. It takes away the pressure, the stress, the worry. It gives me peace to confront each day free of exercise anxiety. It makes me happy to tackle exercise on my own terms, without some preconceived notion of what I should be doing.I should share something else about myself. I am a perfectionist. I want everything to be just right. As child, I tore up drawings that may have had one stray mark. I wouldn\\'t leave my house for school until my ponytails were flawless. My house is clean and neat, my toenails are pedicured and painted, my hair is styled just so. Perfectionism, sometimes just a step away from obsession, can be an unhealthy practice. And for me, exercise was becoming an emotionally unhealthy endeavor.I am confident my perfectionist tendencies will keep me in the exercise loop for all of time. Just knowing I need exercise will propel me to conform. But I must say that I am so relieved to have let go of some of my exercise burden.I like exercise. I really like it. And today, when I ran three miles -- because I had the time and felt up for the task -- it was refreshing, empowering, cleansing. I think it\\'s the lack of pressure that allowed me to lose myself in the moment today. For me, letting go of exercise has lightened the load. Comments: 1. I dunno. Exercise has never been a choice for me. I either do it, or I writhe in anxious, teeth gnashing hell for the day. It\\'s never had anything to do with any desire for health or fitness either. It\\'s pure self-medication, I\\'m sure. Chemo slowed me down quite a bit, but without grinding out the sweat every day, I\\'d never have made it (and, taking those nice looooong gym-visit lunches at work didn\\'t hurt either...)2. It terrifies me that you exercised sounds like consistently and still got cancer! Both my parents died before 55 of cancer and I thought exercise and eating right might spare me from it, but reading your entry makes me think maybe not. Best of luck to all fighting the battle and may we be closer to making cancer a managable condition.',\n",

He was 7-2 with a 4.76 ERA when cancer came crashing into his world. Diagnosed with anaplastic large cell lymphoma in August, Lester received treatment at both the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and at his hometown Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.

       " 'Researchers have found that when cells become cancerous, they become 100 times more likely to genetically mutate than non-cancerous cells. This explains why tumor cells have so many mutations. Good news on the research front. But bad news on the treatment front -- because therapies that target a certain gene may be largely ineffective in controlling cancer.\"This is very bad news, because it means that cancer cells in a tumor will have mutations that protect them from therapeutics,\" says lead researcher Dr. Lawrence Loeb, professor of pathology and biochemistry at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, who presented his findings February 18 at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Francisco.Loeb says chemotherapy drugs target specific oncogenes -- genes that affect the malignancy of a cell -- but if cancer cells are mutator cells, then a single tumor may have cells with all sorts of oncogenes. And while chemotherapy may kill some cancerous cells, millions of others will live on.It\\'s not all bad news, though, says Loeb who believes this research may help doctors determine the stage and malignancy of tumors by testing the number of mutations. It may also help researchers understand what makes a cancer cell a mutator and how to slow the rate of mutation.\"The idea is that if you might normally get exposed to something in the environment at 20 years old that would give you cancer by age 55, then if we cut the mutation rate in half, you might not get cancer until age 90, and you may even die of something else before that,\" Loeb explained.

So she\\'s taking action now and is trying to beat back the cancer curse that seems to loom over her loved ones.Ever since losing her famous father in 2002 to throat cancer, Paltrow has been approaching life from a biological perspective.\"Cancer has been the curse of my family,\"she said. \"I am challenging these evil genes by natural means. I am convinced that by eating biological foods it is possible to avoid the growth of tumors. I began this crusade soon after my father\\'s death. Since then the fight against tumors has been my mission.\"Paltrow and her husband, Coldplay\\'s Chris Martin, have embraced a strict vegetarian diet for their young family, and they hope their commitment to healthy eating will ward off the illness they fear may be headed right for them. Comments: 1. I am an avid believer in proper diet. I\\'ve yet to hear that a vegetarian diet is harmful, or, have negative side effects. Just being sure one is also getting a proper amount of protein as well.I am sure there are many people who are unable to take many meds due to side effects or allergic reactions, as I. So, diet is my alternative medicine.Today, many will lose their battle with cancer. Whether it will be due to genetics or otherwise. As we all know, cancer does not choose who will be it\\'s next victim. So, if a healthy diet can help in being a preventative, thwarting off cancer and other disease, then everyone should start changing their eating habits. Instead of buying a Big Whopper with fries, grab a big healthy salad, and don\\'t forget the watercress!Thank you, Jason 2. One of the first things Paltrow should do is to quit smoking! With all the information that been available to her over the years on the risks and links to cancer and her family history, quitting should have been her first step to a reduced cancer risk. I\\'ve read she has quit and then she\\'s smoking again and not just regular smokes she likes some type of smoke from Ireland with yellow paper and NO filter, Gross indeed. Addressing her diet with a strict vegetarian approach sounds nice but cumulatively has much less impact on her overall health than throwing the pack of butts away. Her children will also not have to put up with her second hand smoke and less likely to smoke themselves. With 5 family members stricken with cancer the smoke has got to go, permanently quit the butts then tell me how well you eat!',\n",
       " 'Wyeth officials say their hormone replacement therapy Prempro is not the cause of one Ohio woman\\'s breast cancer. But two jury decisions prove otherwise.The first jury, in October, awarded Jennie Nelson and her husband $1.5 million in compensatory damages, validating Nelson\\'s claim that her breast cancer -- resulting in a double mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation -- was caused by the Prempro she took for six years. When this verdict was thrown out due to a mistrial, a retrial began. The retrial concluded yesterday -- with a Philadelphia jury awarding the Nelsons this time with $3 million.\"Both times this case has been heard on terms established by Wyeth and still the juries have clearly found that Prempro causes breast cancer,\" says Nelson\\'s attorney Tobias Millrood, adding that Wyeth puts sales ahead of patient safety.Wyeth respectfully disagrees and argues that it acted responsibly in the promotion of its hormone replacement products and in disclosing with doctors and patients all therapy-associated health risks.Millions of women have used Wyeth\\'s hormone replacement therapies to control the effects of menopause, and the company, sanctioned in January to pay $1 million to an Arkansas breast cancer survivor, now faces more than 5,000 lawsuits of this same nature.Despite a large-scale study revealing drugs like Prempro increase the risk of breast cancer if used for five years or more, the drug still remains on the market. And Wyeth is so sure their drug is not at fault for causing Nelson\\'s breast cancer that they plan to appeal yesterday\\'s verdict. Comments: 1. How many times will Wyeth be able to appeal this case? The jury system has concluded that HRT caused this womans cancer. Two juries came to the same verdict.

       " \"Quick autopsies -- or rapid organ donation -- may steer scientists in the direction of better diagnosing and treating the most lethal of cancers. Some 33,700 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year -- and 32,300 will die. There is no early detection test for this disease and early symptoms are vague and may be mistaken for health concerns like indigestion. By the time the classic symptoms -- jaundice and itching -- surface, the cancer has typically spread and patients have only months to live. Rapid autopsies have been used before -- for Alzheimer's and prostate cancer -- but this a first in the study of pancreatic cancer and it just may lead to the discovery of what makes this cancer so aggressive and so deadly.So patients are essentially donating their bodies and organs to science. Organs in the chest and abdomen are photographed, sliced, and flash-frozen before genetic clues start to vanish. Samples of skin, muscle, nerves, lymph nodes, blood, and urine are also studied. Researchers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center are some of the few who are conducting this type of research. From just one patient, they collect 16,000 samples -- and they have studied upwards of 10 patients so far. There is a critical need for this research -- because pancreatic is so different from other cancers. Plentiful tumors can be surgically removed for breast cancer, for example, and the amount of tissue removed allows for comprehensive research. By the time pancreatic cancer is discovered, however, there is no time to attempt surgery and there is never enough tissue to study. Quick autopsies -- which must be conducted quickly after death -- may provide the hints necessary for unraveling the mystery of a cancer that even when operable, still provides only a 16% chance of survival. Overall, less than five percent of patients live five years. Autopsies cost families nothing and do not interfere with funeral arrangements. Results of autopsies -- that make up a library available to international researchers -- may be just what the doctor ordered for identifying methods for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment for a cancer that carries with it little hope.

       " 'A study appearing in the Journal of Clinical Oncology reveals there may be something out there that can extend the lives of patients with recurrent prostate cancer. This something is a new class of anti-cancer targeted drugs that scientists at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles say are quite promising, despite their ineffectiveness in some prostate cancer patients with no previous chemotherapy treatment.Pertuzumab, a molecular targeted compound that has been used successfully in ovarian cancer patients, has been shown to block the human epidermal growth factor receptor family by binding to and inhibiting the function of HER2 receptors. They essentially block a key pathway that leads to cancer growth. And this blockage can possibly offer a better, longer life for recurrent prostate cancer patients whose diseases no longer respond to traditional chemotherapy.Pertuzumab, marketed under the brand name Omnitarg by Roche and Genentech, is just one of many targeted cancer therapies that give researchers hope that cancer may one day be a lifetime disease that can be skillfully managed.

Good news -- the two drugs together stopped tumor growth for twice as long as any other therapy.Gliomas are mostly incurable in all cases, but this new treatment approach may extend life and may help preserve physical and mental function for a longer period of time for patients fighting this deadly disease.\"These results are exciting because of the possible implications for a patient population that currently has the poorest possible prognosis going into treatment -- those with malignant brain tumors that have recurred after initial treatment,\" says the lead researcher whose findings appear in the journal Clinical Cancer Research.

Since the study launch in October 2004, 32,000 women have been recruited.

       " \"I had no idea my February 10 post Some children's bath products linked to cancer would spark such great debate. At the very moment I write, the post has received more than 64,000 hits and 70 comments. I must admit when the comments started rolling in, I was a bit nervous. Even though I merely reported the facts on this topic, had no claim to any of the information, and didn't even share my opinion on the matter, the highly charged words written by so many well-meaning readers made me feel a bit like I was caught in the middle, like I started an argument and needed to jump back in, sort things out, and create harmony among those responding to my words.But then I realized debate is not such a bad thing. It sheds light on all sorts of valid viewpoints. It educates. It raises awareness. And that's what cancer causes are all about.Having read all the comments that now are officially assigned to this one post, I am so much more enlightened than when I summarized the story I came across revealing that some bath products contain a bit too much of a chemical called 1,4-dioxane, a probable human carcinogen that is already known to cause cancer in animals. All I really knew at the time I wrote the post is that the FDA has no regulation over this chemical and that cosmetic companies must monitor themselves. Some don't do such a good job, and herein lies the debate.Some readers say big deal, what's the harm really in a little extra dash of chemical in a whole tub of water. Perhaps if our children soaked all day for many days in this chemical, cancer might strike. But a quick bath with a tiny trace of 1,4-dioxane is not likely to do any harm. One reader wrote that we shouldn't stress so much about headlines that scare us into believing everything causes cancer, that we'll probably live a whole lot longer just living our lives free of constant worry.Another camp of readers say a little bit of something bad is still too much. Over the course of a lifetime, how do we know our children won't pay for our mistaken belief that this hype is just -- hype. Some cancer surviving readers wonder if their cancer was caused by their plentiful childhood bubble baths. And some go to great lengths to find natural, organic, chemical-free products, whatever the financial cost.A few consultants for these natural products left their own comments, claiming to help those consumed with anxiety. Others scolded these business people for capitalizing on the fears of others with products that have not been proved any safer.There are advocates of moderation who wrote. And individuals seeking more information. And people who located resources for others to investigate.There is indeed a rich commentary on the link between bath products and cancer that follows one short post I wrote late one night, after my own children were bathed -- with Dove soap and generic shampoo -- and put to bed. And I am indeed happy to know my small contribution on the topic has generated such a powerful windfall of thought and concern. Comments: 1. Why would you take a chance on a chemical that definately causes cancer? Especially when you are talking about children's bath products. Why do you need all of those additives anyway???? \",\n",
       " \"Breast cancer drug tamoxifen, designed to cut recurrence in women with estrogen-receptor positive disease, has been shown to continue working long after women stop taking the drug. And two studies suggest it might also offer long-term protection for healthy women with high risk of developing breast cancer.One such study found the drug decreases risk of hormone-sensitive breast cancer by 39 percent over 20 years. Another shows a 34 percent decrease for up to eight years after the therapy concludes.Published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, one study -- the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study, or IBIS -- looked at 7,145 women at high risk of breast cancer. And for the first time, clear evidence has surfaced in support of the merits of tamoxifen after the completion of treatment.IBIS study participants took either a daily dose of tamoxifen or a placebo for five years. At the eight-year mark, 87 women who took the actual drug were diagnosed with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer. And 129 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with the same disease.In the second study, researchers from the Royal Marsden Hospital in London investigated 20-year data on 2,471 healthy women at high risk of breast cancer who took tamoxifen for six or seven years. Similar results were found.Despite the benefits of tamoxifen as a preventative treatment, the drug is not currently approved for this use in the UK, where breast cancer is the most common form of female cancer.

       " 'Findings from an international study suggest that women with a waist size of more than 34 inches are more likely to develop cancer of the womb than women who boast slimmer waistlines.The study, funded in part by the British charity Cancer Research UK, sized up 223,000 women worldwide and determined that women with a waistline less than 31 inches have half the risk of developing womb cancer than their heavier counterparts.There has been a significant rise in cases of womb cancer in Britain. And the link between the disease and weight gain is most prevalent among postmenopausal women who have never used hormone replacement therapy or the birth control pill.According to the National Sizing Survey conducted in 2004, the average British woman now has a 34-inch waist. This is more than six inches bigger than the average size of a woman in the 1950s, says Dr. Lesley Walker of Cancer Research UK. \"Women are larger than they were when they existed on a wartime diet and were generally more active and this is having serious consequences,\" Walker says.More than 6,000 women in the UK are diagnosed with womb cancer each year.

And the vitamins may prevent 900 cases of pediatric leukemia and more than 300 brain tumor cases annually in the United States.It's not clear which vitamins or minerals, and in what amounts, could be protecting babies from cancer, but it's possible folic acid -- critical for cellular function -- may be acting alone.One thing is certain, says lead investigator Dr. Gideon Koren -- this is one inexpensive way to prevent cancer. Comments: 1. As a parent of a child with Neuroblastoma, who DID take prenatal vitamins, this article has been bothering me. First - a straw poll of other NB parents shows almost all of us took prenatal vitamins. Moreover, what I do not see addressed in this study is that the neuroblastoma incident rate is virtually THE SAME in developed and non-developed countries. If prenatal vitamins really helped to prevent neuroblastoma why don't we see a difference in the rate it occurs in countries where most of the population takes prenatal vitamins?\",\n",
       " 'Merck, maker of the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil, is backing off its lobbying campaign following pressure from medical groups and parents who believe the vaccine should not be mandated as a school attendance requirement for adolescent girls.The public outcry that caused Merck to announce its stop order on Tuesday stems from the fact that the vaccine protects against the sexually transmitted human papilloma virus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer. School-mandated vaccines are typically for diseases spread through casual contact, such as measles and mumps.Merck\\'s medical director for vaccines, Dr. Richard M. Haupt says, \"We\\'re concerned that our role in supporting school requirements is a distraction from that goal, and as such have suspended our lobbying efforts,\" adding that the company will continue providing information about the vaccine upon request.Gardasil, launched in June and the first vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, has inspired controversy since day one. There\\'s the cost -- $360 for three required shots -- and all sorts of insurance concerns and conservative groups who worry the vaccine encourages premarital sex and interferes with parental rights. Even those in support of the vaccine -- like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Practitioners -- question Merck\\'s quick push to market this drug, especially in light of the company\\'s withdrawn painkiller Vioxx.\"I believe that their timing was a little bit premature so soon after (Gardasil\\'s) release, before we have a picture of whether there are going to be any untoward side effects,\" says Dr. Anne Francis, who chairs an American Academy of Pediatrics committee.Legislatures in 20 states have taken steps to mandate the vaccine for young girls. And with the exception of Texas governor Rick Perry\\'s February 2 executive order requiring Texas girls entering the sixth grade in 2008 get vaccinated, nothing has been made official so far. Comments: 1. Regarding the new cerivcal cancer drug, what always amazed me is that drugs are focused on women. For example, the birth control pill for women. No birth control pill for men. Women are the ones who get their tubes tied. Men seem to refuse to do it, always wanting the female to go through the medical process. Now a vaccine for HPV, targeted only for females. So, why not a vaccine against the HPV viruse for everyone?The new birth control pill which is advertised which makes you only have your period for three days instead of how nature made you so you \"can still have a social life\" make me want to vomit when I see it on TV.Glad to hear Merck is backing town. So many drugs women took during pregnancy have caused birth defects.This drug could affect a whole generation and not know it till it was too late.Maybe humans are supposed to have diseases so we can evolve and develop natural resistance to them.Evolution has stopped with all these drugs.I wish they would pass a law that you can\\'t advertize pharmaceuticals on TV straight to the public.I REALLY wish someone would do something to make a law like that.Mamasayssing',\n",
       " \"It is not yet clear how -- or if -- this will affect American women but a piece of the breast cancer puzzle has been located for Icelandic women. Scientists reported this week that women with a bad gene that raises their risk of breast cancer were almost certain to develop the disease if they also had a mutation of second gene. This gene -- BARD1 -- seems to add a large risk for these women.Two genes -- BRCA1 and BRCA2 -- were discovered 10 years ago and account for 10-15 percent of total breast cancer cases. Scientists have been searching for other genes that act alone or with these two genes to raise the risk for breast cancer. BARD1 appears to be one of the genes they were looking for.&nbsp; Women with a BARD1 mutation and also a BRCA2 mutation -- the&nbsp; most common in Iceland -- have a 50 percent increase in risk. In the United States, BRCA1 is most common so the puzzle is not quite the same. So for the 213,000 American cases of breast cancer that will emerge this year -- making it the most common major cancer in women and the second leading cause of deaths in women -- it is uncertain if BARD1 will be significant. But the discovery of this gene will help unravel the mystery of breast cancer -- and that is a step in the right direction for sure. Comments: 1. You know - for such a small (and often thought of as insignificant) country, we've got a lot to thank Iceland for.Their genetic database project has already resulted in big progress in several areas of medicine - and this breast cancer news is just the latest in a long and impressive line. From what I read the genetic tracking process can be quite intrusive in their lives but - hey - well done guys. Your effort is benefiting women world wide.\",\n",
       " 'There\\'s no mystery about how we might help prevent cancer. In fact, we don\\'t even need to venture out of our own minds to figure it all out.Consider this.\"We estimate that more than 50 percent of cancer incidence could be prevented if we act today on what we already know,\" says Graham Colditz, M.D., Dr.P.H., and associate director of Prevention and Control at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Barnes-Jewish Hospital.And now consider these seven methods for acting on what we already know about cancer prevention.One. Lose weight and exercise more. It is estimated that 20 to 30 percent of the most common cancers in the United States are directly attributed to being overweight or physically inactive.Two. Eat right. Plant-based diets help prevent cancer. Eating fruits and vegetables help prevent cancer. Diets high in red meat and animal fat increase the risk of cancer. End of story.Three. Quit smoking. We all know smoking is associated with lung cancer, but it\\'s also linked to cancer of the colon, kidney, pancreas, cervix, and stomach. Within five years to 10 years, there is a 50 percent reduction in cancer risk for those who stop smoking.Four. Limit alcohol intake. While a few studies claim there are health benefits to drinking wine and other alcoholic beverages, most data show overconsumption of alcohol increases the risk of oral, esophageal, and breast cancers.Five. Increase folate intake. Epidemiological studies suggest that low folate levels promote cancer development. Experts recommend taking a multivitamin with folate every day.Six. Stay in the shade. Limiting long-term exposure to the sun and tanning beds, booths, and lamps minimizes the risk of developing skin cancer.Seven. Avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause cervical cancer. Hepatitis B and C viruses can cause liver cancer. Helicobacter pylori causes stomach cancer. It\\'s critical that we protect ourselves during sexual contact if we wish to protect ourselves from cancer. Comments: 1. I think people are coming around to the idea that they have to take responsibility for their own bodies and the outcome, the consequences if they do not could be fatal.To be able to cut cancer 50 percent, well, that is impressive, and basically it\\'s just common sense that could put a person among that 50 percent.Cancer should be reason enough to change ones life style, eating habits, whatever it takes to lessen your chances of cancer invasion. The 7 rules mentioned, will only lead one to a healthier body and mind. That does not sound so bad. If you have children, this should be reason enough to make some life style changes, for their sake as well as your own. And, if you have no children, then do the 7 for yourself!It\\'s true, people will still be stricken with cancer, whether it be due to our environment, certain foods, chemicals, cleaning products, baby shampoo and other childrens products, you name it.Some people have made the remark that, \"This has gone to far! Everything is supposably causing cancer\". Well, to these people, do your own research, try to find out a little more about the product in question, get involved. I don\\'t know the answer. But I do know one thing, it makes more sense to take precautions, if there is even the slightest chance of a certain product possibly being the cause of any type of cancer, avoid it, until it\\'s safe for we the people.The Seven is a good preventative, also helpful to those already caught by this hideous disease, and other diseases. Some old habits are very hard to break. But if you\\'ve ever lost family and friends to cancer, that is a good reason to make some changes in your own life. Just go visit the childrens cancer ward in a Hospital, do something nice for them. You just might find it easier to throw that pack of cigs away after visiting the very young, to the old, seeing their tired little bodies, bald heads, sickness, faces, sometimes lacking expression, because they are just too tired and weak, or sick, to even give you a smile. God bless them all.There are a lot of support groups out there for people who want to quit smoking, and, for those who need to lose weight as well. Your own Physician will be able to assist you. As far as ones sexual habits, that too is just common sense. With the exception of those who are infected through rape. And then, there is also the internet for support groups. So, you see, there is nothing really stopping us from having a healthy body, mind, and soul,just ourselves. Before long I will have my own cook book, just from the recipies that have been shared here on the Cancer Blog. Good healthy foods! Thanks!Good Luck to all,Thank you Jason ',\n",

In college I had full respect for Kay Yow. She was a coach at Elon University where I attended before taking the job with NC State. Then when she took over at NC State our teams competed against each other. She instilled team work, courage, leadership, a will to never give up, and community involvement in her players, friends, and fans and has always lead as a great example. I wish her the best and my prayers are with her as she battles with the beast known as cancer. May her courage and strength lead her through.2. I greatly admire Kay Yow and her fight against breast cancer. My prayers to the Lord for her healing. To me, it seems that since she has been back coaching the team is playing better, as if they are fighting to win for Kay Yow.3. I met Kay Yow while playing softball at UNC-Wilmington and at that time she was ahead of her time and a leader in the foundation of women athletics of today. I then played softball for Appalachian State and can say we had good games and we only defeated her team once in my career. Coach Yow is a great role model for all to learn from and if you get the chance to work with or play against her, you learn without ever opening a book. She puts real life passion into all she does and cares about what you become under her guidance. Coach Yow, may you fight through your cancer and lead young women to many more great lessons on life through athletics. You are a leader and a fighter, defeat this ugly disease with the same tenacity and courage you have shown us all. You are in my prayers, good luck.Charlotte Kelso4. It is wonderful to have enthusiastic and amazing roll models. There are some days, though, when rest is exactly what I crave. I think we each need to seek our OWN individual wisdom (and take responsibility for our choices.)5. Dear Kay,I pray that the footprints in the sand is always with you.Believe and know that jesus will carry you through.Love Beverly Belcher6. Kay is a person that I admire but have never had the pleasure of meeting. I pray for her strength to continue to fight her cancer and be a winner as I believe that she will be, the road may be long but you have been walking this road for some time and you will BEAT this disease. If giving blood would do anything to help you with transfusions I would be honored to do that for you, anything that will help. I have also wanted to get pink shirts and on the back print something that would relate to your fight and sell them,giving you the proceeds. Always have the wind at your back. I am delighted that you have your doctors/nurse with you at all time, so important for you and for them to have such deep love and kindness that they want the very best for you as do you admirers. :)',\n",
       " 'Some scientists believe that surgery to remove a breast tumor may actually help the cancer spread and have recently reported that this same belief may be the exact reason black women are more likely to die of breast cancer.There is apparently a widespread belief in parts of Africa and the United States that removing a tumor hastens death.\"I must say that I am sure there is more to this than just a myth,\" said Michael Retsky of Children\\'s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston, who shares his opinions in the International Journal of Surgery.Retsky still urges any woman with breast cancer to have her tumor removed. And he says chemotherapy is such standard practice for any cancer threatening to spread. It\\'s a safety net of sorts to catch the cells that get away. So if surgery causes cancer to spread, then in theory, chemotherapy should stop the spread.Retsky, who is not suggesting any change in clinical practice, thinks the subject needs far more research. American Cancer Society experts, who tend to question this theory, agree.\"Whether or not the theory is correct, I have difficulty with the logic that they employed to get there,\" said oncologist Dr. Len Lichtenfeld of the American Cancer Society who says women should never delay treatment for breast cancer.Retsky believes that perhaps surgery, by wounding the body, causes it to produce growth factors that fuel the growth of other, tiny tumors. Or maybe a primary tumor secretes some sort of factor that holds the other tumors in check. When the main tumor is removed, the smaller tumors grow. But it could be that surgery does not cause a spread at all â\\x80\\x93 and that any belief of this nature has no connection with breast cancer tendencies in black women. It may be that black women just have a genetic predisposition for more aggressive forms of the disease. Comments: 1. Surgical skill, both the technical aspect and the intellectual aspect, are critically important.Even when the best of surgeons can do a complete and thorough dissection, sometimes the tumor still comes back, or occurs distally. There is so much of the disease that is not understood.A complete resection may be done, even with poor surgical technique, and the patient does well.This is the complex interaction between the tumor, its stage, its location, size, biochemical/genetic makeup, and the surgeon actually has little to do with it.Sometimes it is a relatively benign lesion, peripherally located, small, no lymph node mets, and a superb surgeon, and the same outcome.Sometimes there is a complex tumor, centrally located, relatively large, a superb surgeon, and with luck (besides the tremendous skill), a cure occurs.Either way, one would prefer the good surgeon and hope for characteristics that allow for a truly complete resection.2. The best method to test for any metastatic breast cancer would be the CellSearch test by J&amp;J\\'s Veridex unit.Immunicon scientists developed this test that will soon be available to colon cancer patients and prostate cancer patients.see veridex.com or immunicon.com for more scientific and product info.dechaumontquitry3. This is still actually a possibility in prostate cancer -- that removal of the primary prostate cancer tumor may remove a primary tumor factor that is keeping other prostate cancer tumors that are dormant in check. Some doctors believe they have seen cases where the initial surgical or radiation treatment, when failing to get all the disease, actually increases the aggressiveness of the disease. The main claimed indicator I recall is a shorter PSA doubling time after treatment than before. My impression is there is a strong consensus, almost an assumption, that this does not happen. If I had to place a subtantial bet, I would bet that treatment will not increase aggressiveness, except in rare, isolated instances. But I still hold such an increase in cancer aggressiveness as a possibility in my own thinking, and it is one of the reasons I have not \"debulked\" the tumor in the prostate with radiation or surgery but have instead relied on advanced intermittent hormonal blockade for my challenging case. (The main reason, by far, I have not had the tumor debulked is that I have done so well on the intermittent approach.) However, I have been able to identify virtually no evidence, other than anecdotal mention from several respected doctors, that surgery or radiation causes increased aggressiveness for prostate cancer, even if rarely. (This possibility of treatment caused acceleration in aggressiveness contrasts to a fairly common situation in which more aggressive disease is identified at the time of surgery or post-surgery pathology than was expected based on the biopsy and other clues prior to the surgery (mostly due to availability of the whole prostate for examination after surgery rather than just a number of biopsy cores, or due to sampling of lymph nodes). This possibility of treatment-caused-increased-aggressiveness also contrasts with a rare situation in which the surgical procedure or insertion of radiation seeds spreads the cancer.)Recently I looked hard for evidence of acceleration of aggressiveness due to treatment in abstracts of published research studies. This included a www.pubmed.gov search for \" pre-operative PSA doubling time AND post operative PSA doubling time \", with variations such as \"preoperative\", \"pretreatment\", and velocity. The results were sparse, bascially demonstrating that researchers are not looking for a relationship between pre- and post treatment doubling time, and that no one has either found such a relationship or found that there was no relationship. I would like to see that kind of study, and I am confident it could be done with existing data gathered for studies already published. If anyone knows of such work, I would appreciate learning about it. I did not look below the level of published research, such as in poster abstracts for instance.Jim (<A href=\"http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147\" rel=nofollow>http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147</A>)4.

       " \"It's been so long I can barely remember the cause of the family rift that kept me separated from an aunt, an uncle, and cousins for many years. All that remains clear is that a once-close family split apart because of disagreement and hurt feelings and that my grandma -- the glue that held this family together for more than 50 years -- was heartbroken. She did everything she could to repair the damage of her splintered family. But despite begging, pleading, and continued prayers, reconciliation seemed impossible -- until it became evident this sweet woman was about to die.The progress was slow and began with a rallying of family members at my grandma's bedside. She was somewhat incoherent at the time, and I'm not quite sure if she realized her broken family was on the mend. But I hope she knows, in some heavenly way, that she is the one who ultimately brought everyone together.After her passing, we all gathered for her memorial service. We took turns spreading her ashes at a tree planted in her honor. We talked and visited and laughed and ate. We broke the ice and opened the door for further interaction. It was refreshing to mourn the loss of Gram without overriding tension and conflict.I'm not sure if family relations would have continued without what happened next. I suspect we may have all returned to our lives and gone our separate ways, happy we had reconnected but still missing the closeness we once experienced. But then cancer entered our lives, shocked us all, and gave us all reason to stay in touch.I was diagnosed with breast cancer not long after my grandma died. And the same people who came to her bedside came to my rescue in ways I never would have imagined in the heat of battle. The same people who for years were absent from my life were the ones offering me support and encouragement and love. They helped me get better.Once I was better, life returned to a somewhat normal routine. And maybe we would have routinely slipped back into our selfish ways. But illness struck again, requiring we all step back up to the plate.My uncle, who has lived with diabetes for many years, was faced this year with losing his foot. Thankfully, he found specialists who gave him hope and reason to travel every month for several months to a clinic in my city, where eight family members live and where options never before available to him became a reality -- both medically and personally.My uncle is doing well, walking on his foot with the aid of a brace. And our family is doing well, as a result of frequent visits, lunches, and continued laughs.It took death and disease to bridge the gap that existed for much too long between the members of my family. And just this weekend, after spending a glorious weekend with my long-lost cousins, I realized we have possibly arrived back where we once started -- before whatever led to our disagreement and hurt feelings drove us apart. I believe Gram is smiling down upon us at this very moment, content at last that her three beautiful children -- and their children and their children -- are again a happy family. Comments: \",\n",

Those with increased risk, like African-Americans who typically develop colorectal cancer at younger ages, should be screened even earlier.Screening -- by way of fecal occult blood test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy -- is critical because colorectal cancer often occurs with no symptoms. Symptoms do sometimes present themselves in the later stages of the disease and include rectal bleeding, bright red blood in or on the stool, change in bowel habits, stools that are narrower than usual, general stomach discomfort, diarrhea, constipation, frequent gas pains, unexplained weight loss, constant fatigue, and vomiting. Persistence of any of these symptoms for more than two weeks warrant an immediate visit with a health professional.Treatment for this disease, which strikes about 153,000 people and causes about 52,000 deaths each year, includes surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.In the spirit of this National Colorectal Awareness Month, experts recommend remembering these important points:   Colorectal cancer can be prevented.   Screening for the disease can identify polyps -- grape-sized growths in   the colon and/or rectum -- that can be removed to prevent cancer from   developing.   The magic age for screening is 50 -- unless you have an increased risk for   the disease.   Colorectal cancer is treatable.   Regardless of your age, know the risk factors, know the symptoms, and know   your family history.   Talk with your health professional about colorectal cancer and your own   risk for the disease.

       " 'Breast cancer survivor Catherine West was married to her husband, Jason, in a very public ceremony in May. The couple beat out 450 other couples battling in the ESPN Marriage Madness competition and celebrated with sports fans everywhere their beautiful union, inspired not only by their love for one another but also by the one-year anniversary of Catherine\\'s double mastectomy for breast cancer.What fans didn\\'t know at the time of the wedding was that Catherine knew in her heart something was very wrong. And just after she returned from her Indianapolis 500 honeymoon, Catherine learned her breast cancer had returned.The 37-year-old from Jupiter, Florida underwent three more surgeries, chemotherapy, and radiation and is happy to report her treatment is complete. She is also certain breast cancer came to her life -- twice -- so she could make a difference.\"This happened to me so I could help other people,\\'\" said West, who volunteers her time for the West Palm Beach Race for the Cure, a 5K walk and run sponsored by Susan G.

       " 'Regular. Strenuous. Exercise. Memorize these three words. Live these three words. And abandon all thoughts of a fitness routine that is easy, moderate, or periodic. Brisk walking, golf, and volleyball are considered moderate forms of exercise. Swimming laps, aerobics, and running are considered strenuous. And these are the activities we should be taking part in -- for the rest of our lives -- if we really truly wish to prevent breast cancer.A new study, published in the February 26 issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine, shows women with a long-term history of engaging in strenuous exercise for more than five hours per week were 20 percent less likely to develop invasive breast cancer and 31 percent less likely to develop in situ breast cancer than those logging less than 30 minutes of strenuous exercise per week.It seems strenuous exercise most affects estrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. But clearly, everyone can benefit from vigorous fitness training -- the American Cancer Society recommends moderate to strenuous exercise five days per week for at least 30 minutes each day -- and this is exactly why I am headed out for a run. Today! Comments: 1. Maybe the government should give out gym membership incentives for all, to reduce amount of money spent on treatment of chronic conditions like Diabetes, depression etc as well as cancer, where as discussed here by you, exercise has been shown to make a HUGE difference. Just another vote for prevention to minimize healthcare costs.2. This is good news. It seems as though healthy dietsand proper exercise can play a big role in cancer prevention of the breast. And, perhaps other types of cancer as well.I can\"t help but wonder about those women who are unable to physically handle a vigorous exercise routine. A coule of friends have physical issues which prevent them from any extreme exertion. So, my question is, can practicing Yoga, meditation, etc..be helpful in prevention of breast cancer, or any cancer for that matter? Do you know of any research done in this area?Obviously exercise will have more benefits to the body. However, I feel it is equally beneficial to have a mental connection, an awareness of your body.Also, I believe that an exercise routine, having it be everyday, helps to reduce stress, which we all know there is abundance of these days. Anything youdo to reduce your stress level has to a plus!Thank you, Enjoy your jog!Sincerely, Jason',\n",
       " \"Someone asked me the other day how I continue to come up with topics for my posts. I wish I could say it was a chore to find material on cancer, but it isn't. There is always something to write about -- so much to write about, in fact, that if I had the time and energy, I could write volumes each day.I find my topics in newspapers, in magazines, and in books. I spot them on television, on the radio, on the internet. I draw from personal experience and from others' experiences. I write and write and write because cancer just keeps on appearing in my life. I wish it didn't.Cancer is everywhere. And it offers me an endless reserve of material that just keeps stacking up. So how do I come up with topics for my posts? I don't. The topics come to me. Comments: 1. Why is there no area that allows me to add comments regarding the Renee Syler story?The story indicates that Renee left the Morning Show on CBS to promote a new book. Kudos to her! I'll make sure to purchase a copy!My family and I were big fans of the Morning Show when Renee was on it. We were all wondering what happened to her. It's good to know that she's moved on to do something positive. She added a lot of positive humor and a good overall feel to the show. We miss seeing her; and frankly we don't watch the show as much as we used!All the best to Ms. Syler!Ernie Hudson\",\n",
       " \"I'm trying to keep breast cancer away. I've had it once, and I really don't want it again. So I am committing myself to all strategies for keeping the disease out of my life -- like eating right, maintaining a normal weight, not drinking, not smoking, and as of yesterday, exercising strenuously.New research shows strenuous exercise is what it takes to minimize the risk of breast cancer. Not moderate. Strenuous. OK, I'm on board. Now I've been a student of moderate fitness for most of my life. But now I'm embracing this new approach, this new way of pushing my body to its near limits. I figure if my choice is cancer or strenuous exercise, I better take the route that will leave me sweating and huffing and puffing, not sick and weak and bald. And so yesterday I took my first stab at what I will try to do at least five hours per week -- what experts say it takes to make a difference.It all started with a warm-up lap on my treadmill -- just one lap at 4.5 miles per hour. Then I upped my speed to 5.3 and ran for a mile and a half. I continued running for another half mile at 6 miles per hour and then began walking again. I started at incline 1 for one minute, then moved to incline 2 for one minute, then incline 3 for one minute, and so on until I reached incline 10. My goal was to then continue walking while decreasing the incline each minute for ten minutes -- but I was so out of breath and fatigued, I jumped the incline down to 4 for one minute, then did 3 for one minute, 2 for one minute, 1 for one minute, and then I stopped. The whole process took about 40 minutes and left me soaked with sweat and gasping for air. Then, just in case my workout wasn't strenuous enough, I did 20 push-ups, a handful of sit-ups, and a few other floor exercises before heading to the shower.So that's my version of strenuous. Now, I don't plan to do this same exact routine for all five hours I must complete each week, but I do intend to sweat and huff and puff just as much as I did yesterday. Because if strenuous is what it takes to ward off evil cancer cells, then I'm game. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'Tears are streaming down my face. I can\\'t stop them, and I\\'m not sure I want to. In a way, I want to feel the tragedy of life lost to cancer because it makes it all real. It makes it personal. It makes me realize the same tragedy could happen to me, my family members, my friends. It makes me want to make a difference even more now that I\\'ve seen the chilling pictures of a young woman dying of cervical cancer than moments earlier when I was moved mostly by my own breast cancer journey.I first read about Heather Lyn Martin on the JANE magazine website, home of a beautifully-written story -- I Hate Tumors -- by Sara Lyle, long-time friend of Heather and senior editor for JANE, a publication for 20-something women. Sara\\'s words powerfully depict the life and death of her friend, stricken with a disease she was sure she would beat. So sure, in fact, she asked Sara to help tell her success story. Sadly, Heather never got to tell much. Because she died much too soon, at the age of 28. So Sara told the story through her own words and photos -- the same ones responsible for my tears -- and has just recently written a second essay, one year after her first story started reaching young people everywhere.Sara wrote Why I Still Hate Tumors after inspiring many young women to open their eyes to the realities of a deadly disease. Her words serve to raise awareness about the dangers of cervical cancer -- and the HPV virus that causes it -- and to point women in the direction of resources critical for preventing and conquering the disease.Sara, because of the death of her dear friend, is saving lives with her message. And she just may save yours.To see all that Sara has to offer in the fight against cervical cancer and other hated tumors, visit her I Hate Tumors website. Comments: 1. So sad Jacki. Talk about heart-wrenching. I remember reading the Jane article too, it brought tears to my eyes too. It also made me realize how drastic of a transformation cancer causes to the body. Sending a hug your way. lesley2. Yes, this article is sad. She was too young to have been taken so soon. Sara sounds like a very wonderful friend and person to carry on for Heather and help so many other also.I shed a tear for all women fighting cancer, for all that are losing their battle today. The unnecessary suffering one has to go through, as just having cancer is not bad enough, one has to deal with the physical agony as well. My heart swells with emotion for the survivors also, for they never know if their fight with cancer will end, or, start all over again, The fight really never ends does it. I pray for the day that Cancer is obliterated.Also, this magazine, Beyond, sounds to be promising. Hopefully, it will reach the young women and teens, capture their interest, so they may become aware, Cancer will strike anybody, anywhere, at any time. It does not care how old you are.My blessings to all, Jason 3. Hi my name is Tamika and I am a 6 year cervical cancer survivor. I was featured in the \"I Still Hate Tumors\" article. Please remember that: All women should get regular Pap testsWomen 30 and up should also make sure to get an HPV testYoung women ages 9 to 26 should talk with their doctors about the HPV VaccineIt\\'s very important. I don\\'t want any woman to go through what I went through. I also hope that you will be able to join me on Saturday, May 19th in Washington, DC for the first EVER cervical cancer awareness walk.

       " 'Skin cancer awareness month doesn\\'t arrive until May, but Olay and the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery have already chosen their spokesperson for the 2007 Skin Cancer Takes Friends campaign.Emmy-nominated Desperate Housewives actress Marcia Cross will kick off a nationwide free skin cancer screening and education initiative to alert Americans about the importance of early detection and prevention in the fight against a disease that has affected her personally.\"I\\'m proud to be part of a cause that is near and dear to my heart,\" says Cross. \"Having had two family members suffer from melanoma, I\\'ve come to understand the importance of skin cancer detection and prevention. Knowing what I know about the dangers of sun exposure, I take extra care to protect myself with a large hat, sunglasses, daily UV protection, and of course, an annual screening.\"Cross has become an partner in the crusade against skin cancer so she can encourage people to protect not only themselves but their family members and friends too.Beginning on April 1, log onto skincancertakesfriends.org to find a dermatologist offering free screenings in your area. Take a friend with you to your screening during the months of May, June, and July and each of you will pay not a penny.Many people don\\'t know just how dangerous skin cancer can be. Yet it\\'s the most common form of cancer in the United States and the incidence of melanoma -- the deadliest form of the disease -- is rising faster than any other cancer. Right now, one in five Americans will develop skin cancer during their lifetimes. And every 67 minutes, someone dies of melanoma.Screening is a must for everyone -- regardless of skin color, ethnicity, age, or geography. So mark your calendar for April 1 if you\\'d like a free screening. If money is not an issue, make an appointment today. Comments: 1. Jacki,Thank you so much for again emphasizing the importance of screening for skin cancer. The survival rate from melanoma which causes 75 percent of skin cancer deaths is directly related to the size at time of diagnosis. We have screening procedures in place for colon cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer, but it is time we have clear recommendations for everyone to be screened for skin cancer.I also applaud your comments to cover up. Sunscreen has not been shown conclusively to lower the risk of skin cancer, and in fact, in countries such as Australia where sunscreen use is the norm, the rate of melanoma continues to skyrocket. On the same note, the risk of melanoma is now one in eighty-four, up from an incidence of only one in 1500 in 1935, a time when sunscreen was not available.Cover up, avoid being in the sun between 11AM and 3PM, and make sure skin cancer screening is part of your health maintenance protocol, along with mammograms and PSA\\'s.Lynne Eldridge M.D.Author, \"Avoiding Cancer One Day At A Time\"<A href=\"http://www.avoidcancernow.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.avoidcancernow.com/</A>2.

Dear Cancer Blog Readers:It is fabulous to see that The Cancer Blog is trying to provide up-to-date, and accurate, sun protection information to its serious, concerned, and health conscious readers. Thank you very much \"Cancer Blog\", for your March 3, 2007 article, \"Marcia Cross chosen as Olay skin cancer prevention partner\", describing the vitally important \"2007 Cancer Takes Friends Program\", and that Program\\'s goal of educating the American public about skin cancer, and backing up its educational efforts with hands-on skin-cancer screening in communities across the U.S.A. This Comment is intended to inform the American public that there is now an important, many would say an essential, new, inexpensive OTC product available in sun protection and short- and long-term prevention of dermatologic disease. The name of the new product is Heliocare.Scientifically and clinically proven to inhibit and prevent sunburn; to significantly mitigate the skin-damaging effects of both UVB and UVA wavelengths of the sun; and to preserve healthy skin in the long-term Heliocare sun protection capsules are a revolutinary new and clincially proven-effective development in the battle against serious dermatologic diseases caused by short- and long-term exposure to the sun.Heliocare\\'s manifold benefits in protecting against the dangers of sunburn [esp. in youth] has been conclusively proven in a clinical trial reported and published in the December 2004 issue of \"The Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology\", titled \"Oral Polypodium leucotomos extract (\"Heliocare\") decreases ultraviolet-induced damage of human skin,\" J Am Acad Dermatol. 2004 Dec;51(6):910-8. Specifically, this important clinical report found, and I quote, that \"A significant decrease in erythema (i.e. sun burn) was found in PL-treated skin (P &lt; .01). Histologically, PL-treated biopsy specimens showed less sunburn cells....\"To millions of Americans (esp. American youth), Heliocare, the systemic (oral) sun protection capsule referred to in the article, is simply a product too important in the prevention of sun-related skin damage and disease not to be brought to the attention of \"The Cancer Blog\" readers. In every way, this \"Cancer Blog\" story is timely, accurate, and helpful. Thank you for getting the word out about skin cancer and the importance of regular self-examination and screening. Equally important is sun protection and cancer prevention. As the \"Comment\" above notes, topical sunscreen lotions have clearly not been enough to stem the steadily rising (2-3%/year) of skin cancers of all types, including the rising incidence of malignant melanomas in ever-younger age groups. 1 -2 capsules/day of Heliocare + application of an inexpensive sunscreen lotion (e.g. \"No-Ad Ultra @ $8.99/16oz bottle) is the best sun protection available on the market. Effective, easy to use, and complete [Heliocare, which \"works from the inside out\", protects all skin sites from the sun). Heliocare sun protection capsules are an essential component, @ 80 cents/day (1 capsule + inexpensive sunscreen lotion = 3.5 hours sun protection; 2 capsules + inexpensive sunscreen lotion = 7.0 hours sun protection), of a complete and effective sun protection program for indiviuals and families, especially the youth of America. SOME BACKGROUND AND FACTS RE: HELIOCARE:Heliocare, a revolutionary and breakthrough systemic (oral) photoprotectant (sun protection)and photoimmunoprotectant (cellular and DNA damage in the skin) product was developed (1992-2004] at Harvard/Massachusetts General Hospital by a Team of the worlds\\' leading dermatologists. Heliocare was nationally launched in December 2005. It is now available in all major chain pharmacies [you need to ask for it at the pharmacist counter], and it is recommended and dispensed by many of America\\'s top dermatologists, dermatologic &amp; plastic surgeons, and pediatric dermatologists: for the prevention of sunburn, the prevention of wrinkles and photoaging, and the prevention of skin diseases associated with overexposure to the sun.It is just fabulous that Americans are taking notice of this breakthrough systemic (oral) sun protection capsule, HELIOCARE. For the first time, Moms and Dads can assure that their families - - - especially their active children and teenagers, often over-exposed and inadequately protected from harmful UV radiation - - - are protected by the complementary sun protection provided by one capsule daily of Heliocare. Compare that cost to comparable protection by sunscreen lotions, and you can see why Heliocare is \"no-brainer\" complementary sun protection.Heliocare is a breakthrough sun protection product, developed over 12 years at Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital by some of the worlds\\' leading dermatologists.Two important Heliocare clincial trials, conducted at Harvard/MGH, have been published recently in the premier U.S.A. dermatology journal, The Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. The results of these clinical trials were dramatic; and have proved that, in several critical ways, Heliocare has significant photoprotective and photoimmunoprotective effects (preventing sunburn &amp; photoaging; and significantly boosting the skin\\'s ability to maintain healthy functioning at the cellular level): See, \"Oral Polypodium leucotomos extract (Heliocare) decreases ultraviolet-induced damage of human skin. \" 2004 Dec;51(6):910-8.The Heliocare clinical trials have additionally proven that Heliocare nearly completely mitigates the harmful effects of the UVA wavelengths of the sun - - and despite the claims of the new topical sunscreen lotions \"Anthelios\" and \"Helioplex\", far too much UVA is getting through the topical sunscreens - - - Heliocare \"mops up\", mitigates, and absorbs the UVA-potentiated skin dysfunctions at the skin\\'s cellular level. UVA that would otherwise wreak havoc on the skin through continued exposure (UVA sun wavelengths are equally strong all year round).See, \"Orally administered Polypodium leucotomos extract (Heliocare) decreases psoralen-UVA-induced phototoxicity, pigmentation, and damage of human skin.\" 2004 Jan;50(1):41-9.Heliocare stands alone as the product of serious scientists and world-leading clinicians. Heliocare\\'s scientific basis and its mechanism of action are proven in rigorous, peer-reviewed and published papers in the premier dermatologic journals in the U.S.A. Heliocare\\'s clincial efficacy in the prevention of skin disease (and its precursors) has not only been demonstrated the clinical trials conducted at Harvard/MGH; Heliocare\\'s effectiveness is proven every day by the 1000s of Americans who use it - - - since Heliocare\\'s national launch in December 2005, the steady stream of testimonials from satisfied patients and consumers daily reinforces Heliocare\\'s worth and value. As Dr. Joel Schlessinger, M.D., President of The American Society of Cosmetic Dermatology and Aesthetic Surgery, stated in August 2006: \"Heliocare -- a pill taken once daily -- offers superb baseline protection and may make the difference between a burn and no burn for your child or yourself,\" said Dr. Schlessinger. \"This product was developed at Harvard University and acts as a super-antioxidant to prevent and repair damage from sun exposure. While it\\'s not meant to be used alone, it can help protect areas of the skin that may be missed while applying sunscreen.\"Heliocare is sun protection \"from the inside out\" - - protecting all skin sites; not only that skin unprotected or inadequately protected by topical sunscreen lotions [e.g. the back; behind the ears].Heliocare is especially important sun protection for American youth: ages 12 - 22. Dermatologists agree that 60%-80% of a person\\'s lifetime dose of sun is received before the age of 18. With the incidence of skin cancers rising at an alarming rate in the U.S.A. (1.5 million NEW cases per year), and with the reality that American youth [ages 12 - 22] are either unwilling or blithe to the need to protect themselves from excessive sun exposure, Heliocare is essential, basic, effective sun protection. A September 2006 survey [Weinstock et al] in the prestigious scientific journal \"Pediatrics\" alarmingly reports that only 33% of teenagers regularly use sunscreen lotion, and that over 70% of teenagers report receiving at least one severe sunburn each Summer! (from, \"Pediatrics\"; Vol. 118 No. 3: September 2006, pp 853-864). By adding (all year round in warm sunny climates of the Sun Belt, and from March to November in Northern latitudes) one capsule of Heliocare to their teenagers regimen at breakfast/before soccer practice or after-school outdoor activities, Moms and Dads can ensure basic sun protection for even the most sunscreen lotion-averse teenagers. While still allowing their youth some, healthier tanning.Numerous, leading American dermatologists across the U.S.A. now recommend Heliocare to their patients as effective sun protection and for the prevention of skin damage and disease.U.S.A.-Heliocare has been sold in the U.S.A. for one year. In five years, Heliocare will be a \"household word\" and well along its way to achieving the goal of the dedicated Harvard/MGH scientists and clinicians who developed this revolutionary sun protection in a capsule - - - improving health, improving appearance, and saving lives.Enjoy the outdoors and the sunny weather - - - and please protect yourselves and your children from the dangers of overexposure to the sun. Please add Heliocare to your and your family\\'s sun protection \"kit\".Thanks very much for reading my post.L. Scott Fitzpatrick',\n",

       " 'It\\'s already been established that type 2 diabetes increases the risk of pancreatic cancer. And now, research indicates there is also a link between type 1 diabetes and this type of cancer.The risk is relatively small -- but still, those with type 1 diabetes have a likelihood of developing pancreatic cancer that is twice as high as in non-diabetics. This is similar to the risk those with type 2 diabetes face.There are many theories about the link between diabetes and pancreatic cancer, and this research -- published in the British Journal of Cancer -- helps narrow the scope of the theories. For example, one researcher says the study rules out \"a cancer-inducing role of the insulin-producing beta-cells in the pancreas, because in type 1 diabetes these cells have largely or entirely been destroyed.\"Experts say people with diabetes should focus their attention on the most common complications of diabetes such as heart disease, eye disease, and kidney disease and not on the very small risk of cancer. In the whole scheme of things, pancreatic cancer is a rare disease -- and even twice the risk is not very significant.

       " 'I\\'m sharing seven bits of wisdom this Sunday that are not my own. I am borrowing them from Pat McRee who has collected all sorts of survivor stories, affirmations, quotations, poetry, lyrics, and resources, has wrapped them with a bunch of hope and humor, and has packaged them in a box she calls Support to Go, The Unbook for the Journey through Breast Cancer. McRee\\'s colorful, lively box contains 80 cards. And on each card is some type of tip, idea, recipe, myth, truth, and essay that makes the breast cancer road easier to travel.Live it. Learn it. Pass it on. That\\'s what McRee says -- and exactly what she did when she stacked her deck of cards with such meaningful and magical material. There is no way I could easily choose seven cards from my own box of support -- there\\'s just too much good stuff, and it all deserves equal attention. So I drew seven random cards from the pile that sits before me, and this is what I got.Queasy Made EasyThis card lists menu items targeted for the chemo tummy. A registered oncology nurse for 20 years, Betty Dozier shares what she has learned about what to eat -- clear, cool drinks, fruit juice, plain baked potatoes, Cold canned or fresh fruit, saltines, rice, toast, clear broths, sherbet, Popsicles -- and what not to eat -- gravy, sauces, potato chips, sour cream, heavy creamed soups.Safety in NumbersMcRee doesn\\'t put much stock in statistics and numbers generated by calculators that have nothing to do with real people. But she does believe in numbers when it comes to survival. On this card, she lists the names of genuine survivors with real numbers. She lists Shirley Weinman, a 20-year-survivor, Janice Johnston, an eight-year survivor, Linda Beebe, a 15-year survivor -- and so on.No Smile Left BehindMcRee offers a prescription for play, an invitation to smile and laugh and rejoice in the face of cancer. \"Cut eye holes in a paper bag and wear it to treatment,\" she says. \"Tell \\'em you just couldn\\'t face another day.\" Another idea -- \"Pass the word that everyone who enters the waiting room will get a Standing Ovation. They all deserve \\'em just for showing up.\"Fuzzy LogicCheck out this oh-so-true poem:Too gray, too wavy, too doggone thick,Smack in the front ... a big \\'ol cowlick!Split-ends and frizzies whenever it rained,Now it\\'s hard to believe I ever complained;So, Lord, let\\'s grow something! I\\'ll nevermore whine ...Gray, thick and wavy will suit me just fine.PostcardsMcRee provides a few postcards intended for mailing to surviving friends. One says, I hear you\\'re patched, retreaded and approved for the road. Another says, U are not alone.Hair TomorrowMcRee offers a souvenir keeper for a lock of pre-chemo hair. Why not save it, says McRee, who shares that what grows back might be as different as your new life will be.Buttoned-UpMake your own buttons -- and wear them proudly.

But I came to know more about St. Jude this year after a friend asked me to make a donation for the Up 'til Dawn program he sponsors on the college campus where he works -- a program that involves more than 150 college campuses nationwide and partners faculty, staff, students, and communities in an extravaganza of activity, education, and fundraising to benefit the children at St. Jude. So I made a donation and then was contacted by St. Jude with an invitation to help them further -- and I did. I sent out 10 pre-written letters to friends and family asking for their support. I was given an attainable fundraising goal. And I met it. So this is why I received my certificate -- and some cheery address labels too.I've learned a lot more about St. Jude this year than I've known before. I learned that St. Jude opened its doors in 1962 -- thanks to founder and entertainer Danny Thomas -- and since that time has treated children from all 50 states and more than 70 foreign countries with Thomas' daughter Marlo spearheading the efforts. At any given time there are about 4,700 active patients at St. Jude where the ability to pay is not a factor. St. Jude is the only pediatric cancer research center where families never pay for treatments that are not covered by insurance and where families without insurance are never asked to pay. As long as children have been referred by a physician, have a disease currently under study at St. Jude, are 18 years or younger, and have not received extensive prior treatment, they are eligible for care at St. Jude. I feel good about my contributions to St. Jude. And my son's contribution too -- he rode this year around and around a bike trail at his preschool for St. Jude's Trike-a-Thon and raised his own money. He received a t-shirt for his involvement. Perhaps we both would not have helped St. Jude at all had it not been for my own recent cancer diagnosis -- which has made me more sensitive to the issues of all cancer patients and especially children. Their stories made me cry when I had no personal perspective on cancer -- they truly break my heart now. And this is why the least I can do is help raise funds so that these childdren may one day enjoy a future full of health and happiness. Comments: \",\n",

The gist of the article is that there's an explosion of effort and activity in cancer research at this institution -- much like all over the nation -- and featured are all sorts of new cancer techniques and strategies and treatments. But one thing in particular stood out to me. What I read -- in the space of just two short sentences -- jumped off the page and really made me think.This one thing is what I am about to share, and I'm calling it my Thought for the Day. It's a great morsel of information -- short, sweet, easy to digest, and perfectly powerful -- and so I invite you to read on, let this string of words sink into your mind, think about it over the course of the day, and then determine how you might use it in your own life. And then come back tomorrow, when another Thought for the Day will await you.Think about this:More than half of all cancer deaths can be prevented by maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Poor nutrition, obesity, physical inactivity, and cigarette smoking together account for 63 percent of all cancer deaths. Comments: \",\n",

Luis was welcomed into a Texas hospital and was showered with an abundance of love from staff and volunteers. Guadalupe did not receive the same warm welcome, however, and was deported back to Mexico. And while she battled to return to her son's bedside, Guadalupe was met with continued defeat -- until her son fell into a coma and border and consulate officials allowed the mother to cross back into the United States where she stayed until her son passed away on Thursday at his grandparent's house in El Paso.Guadalupe had been with her son since May 8, 2006. And an attorney involved in Luis' case says he believes the boy, despite his serious condition, could sense his mother's presence. And everyone involved believes the boy, who was clearly suffering, is now in a much better place. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"I heard the statistic twice this past weekend -- once from a friend who is a drug rep for a prostate cancer drug and once from a friend with a family member struggling with prostate issues. I had never before heard what hit my ears a few days ago, and I was quite shocked to learn this new cancer tidbit -- so shocked I did some research and discovered that what my friends told me is sadly accurate.The good news is that the death rate for prostate cancer is going down, and the disease is being found earlier than ever before. The startling news is what I present today as my Thought for the Day.Think about this:Nearly 80 percent of men in their 70s develop prostate cancer. Comments: 1. Your comment is not exactly accurate.I believe you are referring to autopsy series, or prostates that are looked at after someone dies.The number in patients in their 70s is very high, although not quite as high as 80% I do not believe.The number of men in that have prostate cancer on biopsy is much less than that. As a urologist specializing in prostate cancer, I deal with this every day. We are currently relying on PSA and rectal exams to see who needs a prostate biopsy. Men with a 10 year life expectancy should be counselled and offered a PSA blood test.I applaud the cancer blog for getting important information to the public.I am blogging at the robotic surgery blog.www.RoboticSurgeryBlog.com2. Screening tests may pick up minute tumors that would not progress and might even go away if left alone (pseudodisease). Pseudodisease is most common in prostate and breast cancer, and is an issue in lung cancer. Patients may become alarmed and exposed, perhaps needlessly. There are microscopic cancers that will never cause us problems.When cancer is looked for early, a wide net is cast for both real and pseudodisease. Since we can't tell which is which, we treat it all. Thank goodness for diagnostic tests like Oncotype DX and MammaPrint for breast cancer and hopefully the Lung Metagene Predictor for lung cancer.According to some clinical scientists, it is said that approximately 3% of men will actually die from prostate cancer (generally at a fairly advanced age). But pathology studies show that at least half of all men in their 60's have microscopic evidence of prostate cancer. Most men probably do as they age. If we look hard enough, we will find it.Different pathologists looking at the same cells can reach different conclusions about who has cancer. This has been shown in prostate cancer, breast cancer and melanoma. There is no way to know who is right. Pathologists can readily distinguish between big invasive cancers and normal tissue, but they disagree about what to call cancer in a large gray area in between.\",\n",
       " 'Chemo is tough stuff. That\\'s what my oncologist told me the day I tracked her down on the phone and told her how awful I felt. I was weak, dizzy, pale, and as close to incoherent as I\\'d ever been. I was so out of sorts I was convinced I would jump out of my skin at the very moment this doctor implied all I needed was a firm grip on reality.\"Do you have enough support?\" she asked. \"Yep,\" I replied. I told her my mom lives right around the corner, my sister just a few miles away. I told her friends were delivering meals and my husband was coming home from work whenever I called for him. Help was just a phone call away, and I had plenty of it. What I didn\\'t have was medical guidance about how my body was tolerating chemotherapy. That\\'s why I needed her. I hung up the phone that day having accomplished nothing. And I woke up the next morning barely able to walk. I crawled into my kitchen, grabbed a banana, sprawled out on the floor, inhaled some nutrition, and called my mom. I told her I needed to have my blood examined.My mom transported me to my oncology clinic -- we had a genetic counseling appointment there anyway so it was convenient timing -- and before long, I was hand-delivered a mask and was swiftly escorted to my very own hospital room where I stayed for five days.The day I was admitted to the hospital, my white blood counts were 700. My body was not tolerating chemotherapy. And I\\'ll never know why my oncologist didn\\'t know this, didn\\'t call me in for an evaluation when so many signs were presenting themselves, didn\\'t offer me more than her steadfast declaration that \"chemo is tough stuff.\"Yes, chemo is tough. And there are all sorts of expected side effects of the dreaded treatment that patients must endure. But there are many effects patients should not have to suck up, effects that warrant immediate medical attention and can be alleviated with the right intervention.It took days of antibiotic treatment and a blood transfusion for my body to recover from its chemotherapy attack. I often wonder what would have happened had I toughed it out at home. I suspect the outcome could have been tragic.If I ever have the occasion to preach about the dangers of chemotherapy, which is what I am doing here, I offer a firm warning about how difficult the treatments can be, how anyone with any string of worrisome side effects should seek medical help immediately, how any oncologist who doesn\\'t respond to an outright cry for help should be fired.I learned many lessons from my chemo crusade. I learned how to better help myself, and I learned to report right to the emergency room the second time my blood counts plummeted. I learned to demand the care I deserve, and I found an oncologist who is a warm and caring partner in my pursuit of health. And I learned that chemo is tougher than I ever imagined, too tough for some -- like me -- to go it alone. Comments: 1. I\\'m glad you went to to your oncologist then on to the hospital. Yes, the outcome could have been tragic. Your husband pobably would have had to transpot you before long. Your oncologist should have been in contact with you constantly, or someone from the dept, to check on you. This angers me, because they above all should realize, some people have violent reactions to chemo and different meds. As I have mentioned, this is poison to some cancer patients! I have seen what it had done to my friends. Terrible. Your white count was only 700? Oh Jacki, you were in bad shape.You made it through, you were very wise in not trying to stick it out yourself. This is why my heart goes out so much to those fighting their cancer with chemo or radiation, some just become so ill, and some Drs just can not comprehend this.I am happy to hear you are with a new oncologist. They all should be so caring, congrats!Take care, Jason2. I can relate so well! After my 3rd chemo treatment, I ended up in the hospital for 7 days, being pumped with antibiotics, fluids, and new blood, the whole time. I got sick after each treatment, and each time it got worse, until my white count was almost not there at all. Why it took my doctor 6 weeks ands three treatments to figure out I had a serious problem, I do not understand. I am now on 3 antibiotics, and will be for the remainder of my treatments. I start a new drug next time, Taxol, and I am afraid of what side effects that one will bring. At least I have learned that if you don\\'t feel well for any reason, call Doctor\\'s nurse, or the nurses in the treatment room. The listen and if they don\\'t have the answer, they just go find the doctor and ask.Good luck to you! ',\n",

       " 'The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation recently revamped it\\'s entire campaign landscape. There\\'s been a name change -- Susan G. Komen for the Cure -- and an infusion of more than $1 million into advertising, and a logo redesign, and a whole slew of new slogans intended for magazines and websites and billboards and t-shirts.These changes mark the 25-year anniversary of one woman\\'s gift to her sister, Susan G. Komen, who lost her battle with breast cancer at the age of 36. This gift -- the now powerful Susan G. Komen for the Cure -- is most known for its Komen Race for the Cure, a nationwide fundraising and awareness campaign featuring races attended by more than one million participants. Soon, this group may be known for even more.Sister Nancy G. Brinker, a breast cancer survivor herself, says, \"It\\'s high time we took ownership of the strides we\\'ve made and declare our uncompromising commitment.\"Brinker\\'s declarations are flying. Some people think they are offensive. Others disagree. I won\\'t share my opinion on this Thought for the Day just yet -- because I don\\'t want to sway any opinions. But I\\'d love to hear your take on this Komen approach to stamping out breast cancer.Think about this:Some print and poster ads will feature a woman wearing a tank-style undershirt that says, \"When we get our hands on breast cancer, we\\'re going to punch it, strangle it, kick it, spit on it, choke it and pummel it until it\\'s good and dead. Not just horror movie dead but really, truly dead. And then we\\'re going to tie a pink ribbon on it.\" Another ad states, \"We only focus on one thing. Or, depending on how you look at it, two.\" Another states, \"If you\\'re going to stare at my breasts, ... you could at least donate a dollar to save them.\"  Comments: 1. Seems to me that the millions of dollars being used to change the name, logo, etc would be better well put to use in cancer research itself. We already know and recognize the name so why spend so much money to add \"for the cure\" after it and change anything. It also seems to me that some of their new slogans are directed at men to get donations. Mixed emotions here on those slogans. Younger targeted markets might think they are cute.2. I think these slogans are a wake-up call. Selling pink ribbon tic-tacs and M&amp;Ms isn\\'t doing anything for breast cancer.... people need to know how serious breast cancer is, and more money should be poured into finding a cure, not making money on \"pink\" products. I love this campaign, and Komen is right on target with grabbing people\\'s attention. (I am currently fighting b.c. myself!)',\n",

       " \"Right here in Gainesville, Florida -- at the University of Florida to be exact -- the vaccine for cervical cancer is now available for college students. This vaccine -- called Gardasil -- could prevent women from contracting the human papillomavirus (HPV) which can cause cervical cancer and genital warts. Almost 30 of the more than 100 different strains of HPV are sexually transmitted -- and sometime in their lives, 50 percent of sexually active men and women will contract genital HPV infection. Many will not know they have it and will spread it unknowingly to sexual partners. Protection can come in the form of Gardasil which is approved for use in women between the ages of 9 and 26.Women who are not sexually active are the best candidates for this vaccine because it is clear that they have not yet been infected. The vaccine is not effective for women who already are infected with HPV. And those who don't know if they are infected can determine if they have HPV through a routine Pap smear. If they do not have HPV, the vaccine is indicated. Once the vaccine is indicated, it is delivered in three separate doses over a six-month period of time. Each dose costs $120 -- which may discourage students from this option. About 9,700 women in the United States will develop cervical cancer in 2006 and this cancer will kill 3,700 of these women. This vaccine -- if received well by young women who can afford it -- should prove a breakthrough in cancer research and prevention. Comments: \",\n",

       " 'I tend to think of cancer as a gift. I think it helps me prioritize life\\'s details. I believe it has taught me to stress less. I know it\\'s made me more sensitive to others sharing this planet with me. Yes, cancer has made me a better person. And I consider that a gift.This is not how writer Lauren Terrazzano describes her dance with cancer. \"The truth is, having cancer just pisses me off,\" says Terrazzano.\"I wish I could be one of those people who has had the epiphany, who believes the disease has given me valuable insight into life. OK, I occasionally feel that way, but it might just be the pain medication.\"Neither of us is right. We just have different takes on living with a deadly disease. And our opposite viewpoints make for a rather enlightening study on how cancer affects us all so differently.I regularly write about the blessings I\\'ve found in the midst of cancer. So for today\\'s Thought for the Day, I present to you some thoughts from Terrazzano about how cancer is not always a gift.Think about this:On cancer making her a better personI don\\'t really remember what kind of person I was before cancer. While I may not be better, I am definitely blunter.I often say whatever I want to whomever I want, whenever the moment strikes me. These flashes can be toxic to those around me. I once yelled at a homeless man who asked me for a dollar. I yell at my husband sometimes, arguing about stupid things like how to shove a brisket into the freezer, above the peas and spinach.And I sometimes wish bad things on bad people. Mostly the high-octane evil people, like Osama bin Laden (Why can\\'t he have to go through chemotherapy? Why can\\'t he have a good dose of radiation?). Are these really the musings of a better person? On living each day as if it\\'s your lastNope. Can\\'t do it.While sometimes I am the carpe diem sort of girl, I want to live each day like just another day. I want to watch When Harry Met Sally for the 17th time or surf the Internet for new pictures of Britney Spears\\' bald head. Then I want to cap it off by several hours of reading. Forget Tolstoy, though. I\\'d rather read People magazine. Why do I have to cram life into 20 seconds, while other people have the luxury of doing it over the span of 20 years?On why she is not so braveFirefighters and police officers who plunge head first into dangerous situations are brave. A child protective worker who gets paid next to nothing and tries to be a mother to as many as 50 dysfunctional families is brave. Those people chose their positions in life. Cancer chose me. It\\'s not bravery that gets me up every morning to try to beat back the monster. It\\'s a survival instinct that kicks in, pure Darwinism.The fact is, most of the time I am scared to death. I wear Band-Aids far too long because I can\\'t take the agony of pulling them off. I hate needles (though I don\\'t know anyone who likes them). Why is it that people who hate getting blood drawn are the ones who usually end up with serious illnesses that require getting stuck often? It\\'s a mystery of the universe, much like why tornadoes seem to seek out trailer parks to do their damage. Comments: 1. After reading this article, and, many others that have touched my heart in a special way, I wanted to share one of many poems published and written by my Great Gramdfather in 1961. He lost his wife at a very young age, cancer related. He himself died at the age of 95, natural causes. We all should live so long!Who Wants to Die?Who wants to die and live in perfect bliss beyond the skyAway from mortal sin and destinyTo leave this sphere of wickedness and mirthOf miserable sinners right from birthWhere reason fails and speculation endsAnd one feels a desire to make amends?Poor souls who take the bodkin routeAre judged insane.Who wants to die?Not they who prate and preachTo all and sundry quite benightedWhere\\'er their buyers they can reachWith every sentence copyrightedWho wants to die?When morning gilds the skyAnd hearts rejoicing cryWith joy of livingWhen lilies blow their fragrance thru the airWhen blue skies greet the awakening mornTo make one glad that she was bornWhen good deeds spot this murky worldWith everlasting hopeWho wants to die?When still are many flags unfurledWith challenges to cope?Only when one has done her bestWill heaven provide a perfect rest.Life should not beOf pathways dark and deepBefore we sleep.Who wants to die?Music-I love the harmony that comesFrom silent lips of flowersAnd the breeze that blows through the tall tree topsAfter April showers.Who sings a song has made a prayerOf gratitude for livingFor thankfulness makes her awareOf feeling full of givingThank you for letting me share, these poems have helped me to appreciate life just a little more than before. My thoughts and prayers are with everyone.Jason',\n",
       " \"My hair is not so short, not so dark, not so curly anymore. And the shock of what sprouted from my head following chemotherapy is not so startling anymore. I guess it's a combination of my getting accustomed to my new look and the fact that lately, my hair is a changin' -- once again -- and this has me somewhat numbed to all things hair-raising in my life.I was born with straight, blond hair. And I wore these locks on my head for 34 years. Until cancer came a knockin', chemotherapy came a drippin', and my hair went a tumblin'. Bald brought quite an adjustment. And so did the stuff that replaced my pre-chemo hair.For almost two years now, I have been peering in the mirror at short, brown, curly hair. It took some time, but I grew to like my new look. And now, just as I am feeling OK about my changed appearance, my hair is taking another turn.Naturally, my hair is longer. That's what happens when chemotherapy becomes a thing of the past. So this is not so surprising. But as my hair grows and gets heavier, my curls are transforming into waves. And I wonder if my curls will continue to disappear as my hair continues to grow. Will my hair be straight again one of these days?With each passing day, my hair also gets lighter as it slowly fades from dark brown to light brown with a tint of red and a hint of blond. Will my hair be blond again one of the days?Someone once told me that cancer is temporary. Someone else told me this is not true -- there's nothing temporary about the way cancer changes a life forever. I think I agree. Because as I study my hair, I realize that all of its temporary phases are really just a sign of the permanence cancer has left branded on my body and soul. Comments: \",\n",

But it does lead to potentially unnecessary and harmful treatment.This isn\\'t the final word on the use of CT scans to screen smokers and former smokers for the disease. But right now, the hope some experts had for the special X-rays to detect tiny lung abnormalities has been diminished by a large study that is still in the works. And until conclusive evidence says the screening is useful, the American Cancer Society will not endorse the test.While CT screening did increase diagnosis and treatment -- those screened were three times more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer and 10 times more likely to have lung surgery than predicted -- study co-author Dr. Peter Bach of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York says, \"We don\\'t see a trace of evidence that a single life was saved, that a single case of advanced cancer was avoided.\" And because CT scanning led to more biopsies and surgeries, patients were put at risk for complications such as lung puncture, bleeding, and infection, according to Bach, whose work is published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\"Getting screened for lung cancer with CT scanning is not only unproven, it\\'s potentially a risky endeavor,\" he said.Until an effective screening tool emerges -- possibly still years away -- experts say there is one surefire way to protect yourself from lung cancer. Stop smoking. Comments: 1. The gender discrepancy could very well reflect secondhand smoke exposure. Because more men smoke than women, women may be more likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke, even when they are classified as never-smokers.Pollution may well play a role also in the real low percentage of nonsmokers who get cancer.Failure of the medical community? Why bash them? They work day in and day out to conquer this disease. Right now they are doing the hard daily work to come up with new screening technologies.In the meantime, people should stop smoking and demand stricter environmental regulation.2. How unfortunate that an article highlighting the failure of the medical community to produce a safe and effective means of screening for lung cancer perpetuated the stigma associated with the disease in its conclusion. With recent studies indicating that up to 20% of women and 8% of men suffering from lung cancer are non-smokers, \"stop smoking\" is by no means a \"surefire way to protect yourself from lung cancer\".

       " 'My gut hasn\\'t always guided me through life\\'s most difficult decisions and dilemmas. It wasn\\'t until I felt a lump in my breast more than two years ago that my gut kicked into gear and told me something very important.\"It\\'s cancer,\" my insides told me one week before the surgeon who did my biopsy called.\"It\\'s cancer,\" the surgeon said. I didn\\'t tell him, but I thought it: \"I know.\"I also knew prior to surgery that my cancer had not spread to my lymph nodes. My gut told me this too. It also told me the chemotherapy drug Taxol was not right for me -- since my cancer had not spread -- despite the urging of one oncologist that I accept this treatment. I would have gone on gut instinct alone in my rejection of this medication but another doctor weighed in and agreed with my gut, so I had solid backing on this decision.Many have dismissed hunches like these and have written off those who believe in them as screwballs, says writer Chip Brown in the March 2007 issue of The Oprah Magazine. But as Brown shares after peering into the world of gut instinct, there are 100 million nerve cells in the gut. They run on autopilot, regulate digestion, play a critical role in the body\\'s immune system, and control mood-altering neurotransmitters identical to those in the brain.The gut is essentially a second brain. It was a \"gut feeling\" that led Fred Smith, founder of Federal Express, to begin exploring the possibilities of overnight delivery and Howard Schultz, founder of Starbucks, to begin mass marketing coffee. Wall Street professionals make millions on their gut feelings, sportscasters make startling predictions based on gut guidance, and entrepreneurs launch thriving businesses because of the inklings that rumble in their tummies.You may or may not be a gut thinker yourself. But I\\'ve stumbled upon a gut exercise -- thanks to psychotherapist Nancy Napier --and I\\'d like for you to consider it the next time you find yourself stuck at a crossroads, unsure of where to turn. You never know, the direction you seek may be swirling around in your midsection, just waiting for a call to action.Think about this:You are wavering between two choices. Find yourself a quiet, serene place where there will be no disruptions. Now sit down. Take a moment to settle and focus on the issue you want to explore. Then choose one side. Think about this side and notice what happens in your gut. Do you feel a tightening and gripping or a softening and warming? Are the sensations pleasant or uncomfortable? Notice your thoughts. Are they positive or negative? Give yourself some time to feel your gut and your mind responding. Now shift to the other side. Think about the previous questions, and try to chart what your body gut is saying.While you may not get a gut answer at first, if you come back with the question several times, you\\'ll likely hear just what your gut wants you to know.

       " 'A friend of a friend was diagnosed this week with a cancerous brain tumor -- a glioma to be exact -- and the surgery to remove the mass is scheduled for Monday.I don\\'t know much about this woman or her cancer, but I do know doctors told her yesterday she will likely survive for only a few years. I can\\'t help but think that if doctors had given me this same prediction at the time of my cancer diagnosis, my time would just about be up.I can\\'t fully grasp the magnitude of this sad and sobering news. But I can comprehend that any one of us could be on the receiving end of such an announcement at any given moment. We are all vulnerable. And so I am confronted once again with the powerful and painful reminder that each day really could be my last. Comments: 1. Hi Jacki,Not too long after my cancer diagnosis I met a woman diagnosed with inoperable glioblastoma (a nasty brain tumor) whose doctor told her she had three months to live. Well, we invited that doctor to her 5 year party and to another at 8 years! Theresa lived to die from something else but she felt that death sentence hanging over her head like a hex. My hope is that everyone will realize statistics don\\'t mean squat when it comes to the individual survivor. If we all use the cancer diagnosis as a wake-up call to live more joyfully, we\\'ll have just enough time, don\\'t you think?2. In 1967 when doctors told me they couldn\\'t even guarantee me a year of life, then when I survived that, couldn\\'t guarantee 5 years of life. I also had that sense of death waiting to take me away. As the years went by, and the recurrences kept happening, I became more accepting of death being a natural part of life, like birth, and that there were worst things for me to die from than my cancer. With two near-death experiences under my belt, I am no longer fearful of death. So here I am forty years later at age 61, with grown kids, grandkids and great grandkids. Were the doctor\\'s wrong? Doctors can only surmise one\\'s outcome based upon the statistics they are familiar with. There are always exceptions to the rule. Two years ago I was told I had a brain tumor, slow growing. I have gone through scans every 4 months until January, when the Neuro-Onc told me that he doesn\\'t think it is growing at any significant rate to bother to do a biopsy. That\\'s okay with me. I\\'d rather getting my head drilled for now. I will return in six months and see what happens next. It is daunting to hear that one only has a few months to live, even if it is true, but if one makes that time full of fear and regrets, it is sad. Even if that is the outcome, living each day to the fullest extent of one\\'s being, treasuring what one has, might make it all a bit more tolerable.There is hope.3. It\\'s so easy to get hung up on the statistics, and it\\'s hard enough to keep your chin up without obsessing on which percentage you fall into, and whether the numbers will catch up with you. Life with or without cancer is never a guarantee, so we need to do everything possible to avoid cancer and make the most of every single day whether we\\'re healthy or not.Love to all,Richard Day Gore4. It is said that playing game can reduce risking sickness.<A href=\"http://www.igolg.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.igolg.com/</A>5. I have just completed chemo for breast cancer. My diagnosis was Stage 1 and the statistics I have seen show anywhere from 80 - 95+ survival at 5 years. The oncologist mentioned a 5-6% recurrance rate for my prognosis. For cancer, that\\'s pretty good, but it\\'s not 100%! I find it hard to not go to that 5-6% in my mind. So whether the stats are bad or less bad, I think it\\'s better to try to ignore them. That is the challenge for me for the next phase of this journey I never would have chosen to take. Let statistics dictate treatment plans, but they do not provide meaningful information about how long any of us will live.',\n",
       " \"While sitting in the lobby of my hospital's MRI center on Friday -- time for the annual breast MRI -- I found myself a bit irritated by an appointment mix-up that kept me waiting much too long for a procedure that in and of itself is no real treat.As I waited to bare my breasts and dangle them through square cut-outs on an MRI table, I flipped through a few ancient magazines -- why are lobby offerings so old? -- and as is usually the case when I read just about any publication, out jumped some cancer news.So maybe the wait was worth it. Without it, I wouldn't have found this enlightening bit of information, this thought for today.Now I warn you -- this item I am about to share comes from an October 2005 issue of Parenting magazine, so it's a bit outdated. But it still holds some truth. And if you remember nothing else from this message, I hope you'll take to heart this one lesson -- women tend to overestimate their chances of developing breast cancer.Think about this:   46%: What women estimate is their lifetime risk of getting breast   cancer   13%: Their actual risk  Comments: 1. I was quite the opposite. I never thought I would get breast cancer. I had absolutely no risk factors and no cancer whatsoever on either side of my family as far as I know. They ate more beef than I did, smoked more, drank more and got various other ailments which I felt I was at risk for, but not cancer.I am now in the middle of treatment and sometimes wonder what the hell did I get into to cause this. Was it the bisphenol A's in the plastics, the pesticides on the fruit and veggies or the hormones they now put in the beef. Maybe it was in the makeup I used as a teenager or the makeup I use now. Perhaps all the stress I've been under for the past 10 years at least. Or maybe it was the all the fuel I handled in the gas industry as a truck driver before changing careers.The problem with not knowing why or how, is we could be creating a new situation all over again.Thanks for the article, the stats were a surprise.jan\",\n",
       " \"Inflammatory breast cancer accounts for only 1 percent of all breast cancers -- yet this disease that mostly affects young women and teenagers can be especially aggressive. And sadly, many of the symptoms&nbsp; -- inflammation, irritation, itching, redness, blotching, and increase in size -- are mistaken for infection. Not until further, more serious symptoms arise does breast cancer become a possible explanation. A breast may become firmer, warmer, and may grow in size more each day. Although distinct lumps are not apparent, the skin may become dimpled and increased tenderness can occur. Large veins may surface, and cancer may spread in sheets or nests instead of from a solid tumor -- making it virtually impossible to detect a lump. While mammograms are usually ineffective for detecting this cancer, certain biopsies and MRI testing can reveal and confirm a diagnosis -- which years ago was much scarier than it is today with new studies and research and therapies that can better fight this aggressive form of cancer.A combination of the drugs Lapatinib and Capecitabine have been used to treat inflammatory breast cancer in women who have not responded to standard therapies. And this combination is doubling the patient's survival time. Like like the drug Herceptin -- used for many young women with another aggressive form of breast cancer -- these drugs may be the innovative new approach for saving even more young women.

       " 'A little bit of education goes a long way, especially in the war against cancer. Armed with facts and figures and know-how, we can help advance prevention and early detection of this deadly disease. So in the spirit of National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, here are seven truths that serve to broaden your horizons about the third most common cancer found in men and women in this country. As you read these truths, be aware that the death rate from colorectal cancer has been on a downward climb for the past 15 years due to better screening, fewer diagnosed cases, early detection, and more advanced treatment. Keep in mind that you can help keep this trend going by raising your own awareness and by taking action on behalf of yourself and your loved ones.   Colorectal cancer refers to cancer that starts in the colon or rectum.   These cancers begin in the digestive system where food is processed to create   energy and rid the body of solid waste matter.   Colorectal cancers develop slowly over a period of years and mostly begin   in the form of polyps -- growths of tissue that start in the lining and grow   into the center of the colon or rectum. Removing polyps early may prevent them   from becoming cancerous. More than 95 percent of colon and rectal cancers are   called adenocarcinomas.   For people of average risk, screening is recommended beginning at age 50.   Those whose risk is higher than average should talk with a physician about   appropriate screening.   Screening is used to detect disease in people who do not have any   symptoms. In many cases, screening tests find colorectal cancers at an early   stage and greatly improve the chances of successful treatment. Screening tests   can prevent some cancers by allowing doctors to find and remove polyps that   might become cancer. There are several tests used to look for colorectal   cancer. Ask your doctor what test is best for you.   Treatment for colorectal cancer includes surgery, radiation therapy,   chemotherapy, and newer targeted therapies.   The American Cancer Society predicts   there will be 112,340 new cases of colon cancer and 41,420 new cases of rectal   cancer in 2007 in the United States. Combined, the diseases will cause about   52,180 deaths.   The Colorectal Cancer Coalition -- or C3 -- is a national organization   whose mission is to eliminate suffering and death due to colon and rectal   cancer through advocacy. Visit here for more information.   The material shared in this post was gathered from the websites of the American Cancer Society and the Colorectal Cancer Coalition. Comments: 1. Hi There, I would like everyone to know that myhusband\\'s \"innocent\" polyp turned stage 3 in about3 months.

       " 'Doctors prescribing anemia drugs for patients with kidney disease and cancer were urged by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday to carefully dispense of these drugs due to an increased risk of death and other serious problems, such as blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks in patients with chronic kidney failure and rapid tumor growth in patients with head and neck cancer who receive doses higher than recommended.The potentially harmful drugs, sold under than brand names Procrit, Epogen, and Aranesp, are genetically engineered versions of a natural protein -- called erythropoietin -- that increases the number of red blood cells. The drugs, with combined 2006 U.S. sales of $10 billion, are commonly used for patients with certain forms of kidney disease and for those receiving chemotherapy for cancer.The FDA is adding warnings to the drugs\\' labels that will strongly instruct doctors to use the lowest possible dose needed to help patients avoid blood transfusions. The FDA will also take a close look at how the drugs are marketed, including claims the drugs can improve the quality of life.A meeting of FDA officials to further discuss this issue, believed to stem from drug overuse by dialysis centers and oncologists who make more money by using more of the drugs. is scheduled for May 10. Recommendations could lead to additional revisions of the drugs\\' labels.

I wonder if reporters arn\\'t put onto the story by insurance companies? Superficially, it sounds like a great expose, greedy clinics/doctors trying to make money by pushing drugs. The New York Times article states that the drugs, given by injection, have been heavily advertised, and there is evidence that they have been overused, in part because oncologists can make money by using more of the drug. That\\'s not really a new revelation. We\\'ve been down that road before without much done to change it.According to Dr. John Glaspy, director of UCLA\\'s Outpatient Oncology Clinic, one complicating factor, experts say, is that oncologists make significant revenue buying cancer drugs from manufacturers and charging patients a higher price for receiving the drugs in their offices. That profit motive could influence some doctors\\' decisions. However, patients with anemia, which can cause sluggishness in its early stages and can be fatal in advanced phases, can get blood transfusions, typically every few weeks, instead of using EPO.Could it be that increased numbers of red cells deliver more oxygen to the tumor cells and thereby increase their activity across the board, including with respect to invasion, proliferation, and metastasis? On one hand they\\'re developing drugs to halt and reverse angiogenesis while on the other hand they\\'re helping the tumor to obtain more oxygen with existing vasculature. And nobody in charge foresaw that? Amazing how they can apply differing standards for proof or benefit when profit is involved.Medicare and insurance companies have pretty strict guidelines about how low the hematocrit must be in order for them to be eligible for reimbursement. But some patients feel draggy/listless/weak when their hematocrits are above the cut-off levels for reimbursement (meaning they have to wait until their levels drop low enough).Maybe this could be one of those situations where what makes the doctor money also could help the patient considerably? The real loser in this are the patients who have to pay for the drugs, who would be happier were they just be moping around at home, as opposed to out living full lives. These drugs have shown signs that they could improve the quality of life for both dialysis and cancer patients, even though their safety labelling has already been revised three times since 1997. Let the patient be the judge?3. In panel discussion that highlighted the 12th annual conference of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, Lee Newcomer, former chief medical officer and currently an executive with Minneapolis-based United Health Group, pointed out that in reviewing records of patients who were prescribed the drug erythropoietin -- an expensive agent that boosts blood supply in patients with anemia -- said that 44 percent of those patients had blood work-ups that would indicate they were not anemic.Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow. As a therapeutic agent, it is produced by recombinant DNA technology. It is used in treating anemia rsulting from chronic renal failure or from cancer chemotherapy. A six-month course of treatment can cost more than $10,000 per patient.Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the Atlanta-based American Cancer Society, told United Press International, \"Probably more than a billion dollars is spent on erythropoietin each year, which makes it one of the most expensive cancer drugs.\"Newcomer said he objected to prescriptions for erythropoietin written for patients with hematocrit higher than 36. Low hematocrit, the ratio of the volume of red cells to the volume of whole blood, is an indication of anemia, Lichtenfeld said. Normal range for hematocrit is different between the sexes and is approximately 45 percent to 52 percent for men and 37 percent to 48 percent for women. Lichtenfeld said clinicians generally would not treat a hematocrit that was about 36 percent.Newcomer also stated at the meeting that when he scrutinized prescribing habits for treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer, their were doctors writing prescriptions for 188 different combinations of treatments, yet there are only two drugs that have any activity against that disease.Newcomer also cited in the meeting last year that the use of the new breast cancer drug tratuzumab, sold as Herceptin, which has been found to be helpful in a group of women with breast cancer that overexpresses a certain gene known as HER2. The drug is ineffective in women with normal levels of HER2, yet about 12 percent of drugs orders -- which costs thousands of dollars per treatment -- were for women who tested negative for HER2 overexpression.One of the newest biological targeted agents, bevacizumab, sold under the trade name Avastin, which is rapidly being included in numerous drug cocktails because it has been shown to extend survival in diseases such as colon cancer, can cost as much as $47,000 a year for one person.Newcomer stated, \"We know that Avastin improves outcomes in about 20 percent of patients, but we have no idea which cancer patients will benefit from a course of treatment.\" According to his calculations, it costs $354,000 per year of life extended with Avastin.<A href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/index.php?feed=Science&amp;article=UPI-1-20070316-20215500-bc-us-cancercosts-analysis.xml\" rel=nofollow>http://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/index.php?feed=Science&amp;article=UPI-1-20070316-20215500-bc-us-cancercosts-analysis.xml</A>',\n",
       " 'More than 47 percent of people view their pets as family members, according to a 2002 American Veterinary Medical Association survey. It makes sense then that people are routinely treating their pets for ailments that might strike a family member -- like arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, allergies, dementia, obesity, and yes, cancer.New studies show that Americans are stuffing their pets with more drugs than ever before. They are medicating their dogs, cats, and sometimes other pets as much as they medicate themselves -- and they are doing it with many of the same human drugs they use for themselves, like steroids for inflammation, antibiotics for infection, anti-depressants for anxiety, and even new slendering drugs for obesity.It\\'s a big market -- pharmaceuticals for pets -- and for those who love their pets so much they can\\'t let go, going to extremes is worth every penny.Think about this:   For dogs and cats alone, Americans spent $2.9 billion on pet drugs in   2005. While this is equal to only one percent of human drug sales, the market   has grown by half since 2000.   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved more than 40   new pet drugs in the past five years.   A single three-month course of pet chemotherapy can cost $3,000 -- and   chemotherapy doesn\\'t typically extend the life of an animal as much as it   soothes symptoms of the disease.   Health insurance for pets was nearly invisible in 2002 but has gained   popularity over the past few years. Premiums can cost $30 per month, and the   total market is expected to climb to $500 million in the next five years.     Some human drugs leave pets with unexpected, sometimes deadly, side   effects. The drug Rimadyl, made by Pfizer and used as a treatment for dogs   with arthritis, has been shown to cause kidney and liver damage in some   animals. More than 3,000 pet deaths have been attributed to this drug.     Some question the priorities of a society that allows for medically   treating pets like they are humans. Dianne Dunning, an ethicist at N.C.   State\\'s vet school is concerned that millions of animals are lost, unwanted,   and euthanized while millions are spent on pet medicines. David Rothman, an   expert in medicine\\'s role in society from Columbia University, says, \"If you   can\\'t get malaria drugs in some Third World countries, what are we doing with   chemotherapy for cats?\"   Others don\\'t flinch at the expense it requires to keep their pets   alive. One man, whose dog was expected to die of lymphoma within weeks, still   enjoys the company of his pet some two years later. Chemotherapy saved the   dog\\'s life and when asked if he thinks the drugs are too expensive, this man   says NO -- because his dog is still here. Comments: ',\n",
       " 'She doesn\\'t have breast cancer. But she did have both breasts removed and reconstructed in January to ensure as much as she can that she will never develop the disease that has struck both her mother and father.It\\'s the dad connection that puts RenÃ© Syler, former anchorwoman for The Early Show, at such risk for breast cancer. That and the dozens of microcalcifications -- these can indicate cancer -- that repeatedly revealed themselves on mammograms and the diagnosis of atypical ductal hyperplasia that increases the risk of cancer. And while cancer was never diagnosed for this woman who was sure the disease would one day catch up with her, Syler is no stranger to the world of biopsies. And her breasts -- misshapen, shriveled, collapsed, and scarred from so many surgical procedures -- were proof of her frequent rides on the breast cancer merry-go-round.Now Syler\\'s breasts are gone. And she is breathing a great big sigh of relief. She calls her new \"girls\" incredible.

I am currently agonizing over making my yearly mammogram appointment, it is just awful to go through the anxiety of it all. I have had numerous biopsies in the past and just keep praying every year as the time approaches for another clear one. I admire her bravery, and hope she has found peace with it all. She is very beautiful.2. I am encouraged that her surgery went well. I am scheduled to undergo a lateral mastectomy w/reconstruction for non invasive cancer (as far as is known) in about ten days. I dread it, but it gives me the best chance to avoid an invasive recurrence. To every woman out there, don\\'t skip that yearly mammogram. Make sure you go to a good breast center to have it done, even if it means traveling to another town. A mammogram is only as good as the radiologist who reads it.3. Well, well well, censorship on the internet?Since the story is about Renee Syler and she\\'s not a one-dimensional figure but a real live person with more than one thing happening in her life, I guess my comments about her being \"fired\" from the Early Show are \"relevant\".I miss seeing her on that show; and b/c she\\'s no longer on the show, I choose to watch something else.

Within the next month I had to have another surgery for a large mass that looked cancerous, and with in the following month another. The doctors then told me given my family history and the way my breast were changing I would be battling breast cancer and had to make a choice. I made the choice to live and remove my breast. I am a Mother of 3 beautiful boys. You made the right decision, so did I. I would do it again in a heart beat. Carm12. \"MAY ARMS OF COMFORT SURROUND US ALWAYS\"13. I am currently facing the very same decision. It is so reasuring to see a happy result, after such an agnonizing decision. Thank you to the brave women who encourage others with similar issues. I can\\'t imagine making this decision without their example! Linda 14. My mother is a 5 year survivor and as Renee I have had 2 surgeries in the past 2 years for calcifications. I had my 6 month check this week and it showed up again. Seeing her story is helping me to make the hard decision to have the surgery. 15. After genetic testing revealed that I carried the BRCA-II gene, I also decided to have prophylactic bilateral mastectomies, and a complete hysterectomy, as this gene is high risk for breast and ovarian cancer. It was actually a very easy decision to make after losing so many people in my family to cancer. My message, however, is that my gene came from my father\\'s side of the family, so don\\'t listen to the old addage that it doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s not from mother\\'s side! Genetic testing is very easy (if a little pricey), and the sure way to know. Be proactive about your health. I have alway told my children that my goal in life is to live long enough to be a burden to my children - now I\\'m on my way!!!16. The other day my mother told me of your story. She had seen you on Oprah. She told me how courageous you were and how difficult the decision must have been for you to have a bilateral mastectomy. She is right of course, but now your worries of breast cancer are over. As my mother expounded on your bravery, I could`nt help but wonder if she thought my decision to have a bilateral mastectomy in Nov. 2005 due to cancer in both breasts was a hard decision to make. Thanks for letting me sound off a bit, because I can`t bring myself to sound off to her. 17. I did not see Renee on Oprah, but a co-worker suggested that I go to the archives and read about Renee. My mother battled breast cancer twice within a five year period. The first occurrence, she was diagnosed at Stage III. She was diagnosed at Stage IV at the second occurrence, and I\\'m sad to say that my mother passed away in June of 2006. In April 2006, my mother\\'s sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at Stage IV, and she joined my mother in November 2006. Now, I have been told that I have calcifications present in both breasts along with several cysts. I recently had the BRAC test done and should have results in 2 - 3 weeks. Once I receive my results, I will be scheduled for a double mastectomy. And if my test results are positive for the BRAC gene, then I will schedule a hysterectomy once I have recovered from the first surgery. Renee\\'s message has confirmed that my decision is a great decision...I choose to live for my children and grandchildren. Renee--God bless you and please continue speaking about this situation. Ordinary woman can not get the message out to others, but I believe your leaving the Early Show was the beginning of our crusade...Thanks for discussing your discussion with Oprah.....18. I did the same thing! I\\'m a mother of three and at the age of 36 I had a hhysterectomy followed by a double mastecomy after watching my aunt and mother both dying at 45 an 50. Too young. I am BRCA 2 positive. I have the gene for both breast and ovarian cancers. I might get hit by a car or something else, but I will not die from breast and ovarian cancers. At the age of 38 I feel great and I tell everyone what I have done because I\\'m here to tell it and I feel great!19. My sister-in-law gave me her copy of the recent People Magazine with Rene\\'s article. I had a bilateral prophylactic mastectomy on December 29, 2007. After 4 biopsies for suspicious lumps, I was diagnosed with phyllodes tumors and LCIS in both breasts. I knew right away what I needed to do but I went through all of the \"proper\" channels. I received second opinions from oncologists, surgeons, my OB-GYN and my family doctor. The surgeons and oncologists all said that they could probably \"cure\" my cancer if it occurs. I chose not to give cancer much chance of happening. I have a good friend who had bilateral prophylactic mastectomy done about twelve years ago due to family history. She is still cancer free and has never regretted her decision. Kudos to you, Rene, and all women who opt to take charge of their own health. God Bless you all., Teresa',\n",
       " 'Newer versions of oral contraceptives -- with lower levels of estrogen and progestin -- reduce the risk of ovarian cancer more than older concoctions of birth control pillsResearchers at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, whose work is published in the Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, say birth control pills have long decreased the risk of ovarian cancer. But over the years, doses of hormones in these pills have been decreased to reduce side effects -- and this seems to have an even stronger protective effect against the disease.Studies show for women who had used any oral contraceptive a 50 percent reduction in risk of developing ovarian cancer compared to women who had never taken the pills. This risk was reduced by 38 percentfor women who took high estrogen and high progestin pills and by 81 percent for those taking pills with low levels of these hormones.\"Up to 42 percent of ovarian cancers might have been avoided if all women used some form of combined oral contraceptive pills,\" say researchers.\"An estimated 73 percent of ovarian cancers might have been avoided if all women used oral contraceptive pill formulation of low estrogen and low progestin.\" Comments: \"Up to 42 percent of ovarian cancers might have been avoided if all women used some form of combined oral contraceptive pills,\" say researchers.',\n",
       " 'Today I offer you not so much a Thought for the Day but a Question for the Day. Before I ask my pressing question, though, I want you to consider this story.Diagnosed with a rare malignant melanoma on her retina in 2001, Ann Guthrie, a South Carolina wife and mother of two grown sons, endured radiation and chemotherapy. The treatments shrunk Guthrie\\'s tumor, but another mass appeared two years later, forcing the removal of her right eye.At about the same time Guthrie lost her eye, cancer was discovered in her lungs. It was inoperable. Then cancer landed in her brain. And now, without any approved treatment avenues, Guthrie is out of options.Like many people with terminal illnesses, this woman is willing to try just about anything -- a clinical trial, experimental drugs, risky treatments -- to extend her life. If she\\'s going to die anyway, why not? She just might live longer. And if she doesn\\'t, she could at least help advance science by offering herself up as a sort of guinea pig.While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed changes that would make it easier for patients to access options like these, it\\'s just not that simple right now.There are ethical issues -- like weighing the needs of people who think anything is better than death against the need of society to prove drugs and treatments work safely. The only way to ensure a sort of balance is through clinical trials -- and letting anyone participate in clinical trials, for example, would make the results harder to interpret.And there are medical and legal risks. What if terminally ill patients end up in worse shape after a treatment with an experimental drug, for example? What if the FDA or a physician is considered responsible for adverse drug reactions?Denying terminal patients their last bits of hope is difficult. \"It\\'s a hard discussion to have with a patient and his family,\" says one doctor. \"There\\'s a lot of tears. We all would love to be able to get them access to some form of therapy.\"And now for my question:What do you think about terminally ill cancer patients and their access to anything that might extend -- or save -- their lives? Comments: 1. I\\'m all for offering any hope, even if it\\'s just some kind of palliative medication. This is the kind fo thing that will be mucked up by legal wrangling stemming from potential \"liability issues,\" while people go on suffering.Regards,Richard Day Gore2. Hi, Hopefully what I am about to write will help some \"last resort\" Cancer patients out there choose something other than taking the newly FDA approved Drug \"Vectibix\" (Paintamumab). My Wife has stage 3 Colon cancer and she has battled it fo r5 years now, she has been operated on 3 times, she has taken everything there is to take, includine this newly released Drug (jan, 2007).I am a first hand witness to the fact that this particular Drug (in her case) has caused her far more pain, suffering and damages than the Cacer. If the Lord had not interviened on her behalf, she would have received a 5 dose this past week and I honestly believe it would have killed her. She has gone down quicker the last 4 or 5 weeks while taking this drug than at any other time in the 5 years she\\'s had Colon Cancer, She has experienced a max. level of every side effect this Drug has been know to cause and believe me, most of there are far more damaging and painful that the Cancer itself. If I were to give it to a sick dog, the animal protection people would have me put in jail for murder by lethal injection. 3. I am a stage 4 melanoma survivor (so far) and I have shifted my engineering/analytical mind to alternative medicine. I have come across too many other cancer survivors who beat cancer thru diet and supplements. While conventional medicine may decide not to offer any other treatments, alternative medicine is always another option. Having had a brain tumor almost immediately disqualifies me for clinical trials or experimental help. I have decided that should it come back and one day it will (maybe next month maybe in 30 years) I will choose to look at what doctors refer to as hocus pocus medicine because I believe there is far more they don\\'t know about it than they do know.4. Sometimes, living the moments we have might be the better option then living but so drugged due to pain or some other nasty side effect.I would fight till, like in the case, there is no options, and then live life to it fullest.

       " \"I often note the passage of time according to events. My husband does it with songs -- if he hears Cheap Trick's I Want You to Want Me, for example, his mind takes him back to a buddy's basement in Jersey where he played pool with a bunch of other 10-year-old boys. Music just doesn't do it for me. It has to be some sort of happening for my mind to travel back in time -- something like the Florida Gators SEC victory over Arkansas on Sunday.Last year, the Gators were also SEC champs. And the year before that too. And I think I'll know the status of this team at this same time every year for as many years as I survive cancer -- because two years ago, I sat cooped up in a University of Florida hospital room trying to recover from the effects of chemotherapy and the only real excitement piped into my cubicle of a room was the thrill of a big Gator win.It was the same kind of win the team repeated the following year -- the win that marked my first year of survival. And now, the Gators win again. And so do I.While the defending National Champions celebrate their accomplishments and head into the first round of NCAA tournament play in New Orleans, I celebrate my accomplishment -- surviving cancer for two years. And when the Gators play in whatever game comes their way next March, I will be reminded of that same hospital room, that same dark and dreary time in my life. And then I will marvel at the power of time and the unlikely collision of cancer and college basketball.And then I will pause, reflect, and head straight into my third year of survival.Go Gators!

Yet cancer is the word most often used to describe this man.But maybe not for long.Could it be that Sievers -- a man whose life has been derailed by a deadly cancer traveling throughout his body, a man who has been contemplating death with each passing day -- may soon be rid of cancer altogether?Actually, Sievers already sees glimpses of cancer falling to the wayside.Having undergone a new procedure called Radio Frequency Ablation -- where needles are stuck into tumors, burning them away from the inside out -- Sievers sees a brighter future.

       " 'Before my radiation for breast cancer, I heard horror stories about the treatment. I heard that I might be extremely tired and severely burned and that I might feel generally unwell for the time it would take to completely zap any and all traces of cancer surrounding my breast. But my own radiation wasn\\'t all that bad -- and really, the worst part of the whole therapy for me was the drive to and from the cancer center every day for seven weeks. It was a hassle, a nuisance, a bother. There were other small annoyances throughout the course of my radiation, but they were minimal -- thanks to some secrets that were shared with me along the scorching path of radiation and beyond. And here are seven of them.Take it easy. Rest. Take naps. Radiation does seem to cause fatigue -- although it is unclear why this happens -- and while my fatigue was not extreme, I did encounter some sluggish moments. My radiation appointments were in the morning and by the time evening snuck up on me, I was often fighting to stay awake. So plan some down time into your days, snuggle up on your couch when you can, and get a good night\\'s sleep.Soon after radiation begins, skin can become red and irritated and possibly blistery -- and wearing a bra can become uncomfortable. I tried bigger bras -- so they were not so tight against my skin -- and jog bras and athletic shirts with built-in bras and then I settled on a bikini top with ties behind my neck and back. This option allowed me to tighten or loosen the ties as necessary -- and the fabric touching my tender skin was minimal. Consider purchasing soft, light-weight shirts that only delicately graze the skin to minimize discomfort on sore spots. A local store in my city carries camisole shirts made specifically for women receiving radiation for breast cancer. While they are costly, insurance pays a portion of the cost.The only three items I was permitted to use on my skin were 100 percent Aloe, Dove soap, and calendula ointment -- this ointment is a homeopathic concoction made from a flower. I bought it at a health food store and used it to soothe and protect my skin. Do not use lotions, powders, deodorants, perfumes, sunscreen -- anything really -- on the affected skin. They can cause further irritation and may interfere with the radiation process. For sun protection, cover all affected skin with clothing and try to avoid any sun exposure. You might try to avoid the heat too -- as it can cause itching and discomfort. Extreme cold may bother your skin too.If your underarm is in the treatment field, do not shave this area. This may injure the skin or make skin reactions worse -- and it will hurt too. Consider it a treat that you can go without shaving for a while. I sometimes still avoid shaving under my affected arm -- where I still have scars and some numbness which makes shaving a bit uncomfortable.I was referred for physical therapy during my radiation treatment once I noticed my arm did not stretch and move as well as my other arm. I thought this was due to my lumpectomy that took four lymph nodes and left me with scar tissue. And while this may contribute to the limited movement, I learned from my physical therapist that radiation affects range of motion. So for months, I saw my therapist for massage and for lessons in strengthening and stretching this arm. Now that my physical therapy has concluded, I am working with a personal trainer to make strength training a way of life.And finally, try to eat small healthy meals during radiation and drink a lot of water too. Some people experience nausuea, loss of appetite, and other eating issues throughout this treatment -- although I did not -- so maintaining a healthy diet is important. Patients are weighed prior to each treatement and in my case, a loss of two pounds or more in one week would have resulted in my referral to a dietician. My radiation therapy ended one year ago. And while I am left with tiny blue tattoos -- they were used for lining up the machines that zapped me -- and some restricted movement in my arm, I do believe radiation was not overwhelmingly bad. It was okay. It was manageable. And now it\\'s over. Comments: 1. Hello,I agree with most of what is being said in this article. I believe there are solutions to manage the process right from the start.My name is Ivan Solero and I am the VP of Marketing for Lindi Skin. We are a skin care company that specifically makes products for people who are going through cancer treatment. We have a skin cooler that is very appropriate for individuals going through radiation treatment. It is a hydro-gel with aloe, green tea and water. It has been very effective to mitigate the \"burn\" associated with radiation. Additionally, it hydrates the skin and cools the skin. It is non tramatic,meaning it does not stick to the skin at all and comes it a 5 ft. roll or pad. The roll is particularly good for breast cancer patients as it is pliable to any part of the breast areas. To find out more, visit www.lindiskin.comI hope you find this help. All the Best, Ivan Solero2. This is a great post JackiI\\'ve mentioned it and added a permalink from our beating breast cancer blog.You can\\'t ever beat advice from someone who has been there .... done that ... got the T shirt !Well done again3. My mother recently finished 6 weeks of radiation due to breast cancer. Her last treatment was on July 14th and for the past 3 days has had her entire body itching. After looking on the internet and calling her Doctor know one seems to know why. We have been told that this is common after treatment in the area treated; however, it is all over. Does anyone have any information related to this? I am concerned as well as my mother. Thanks in advance for any information.4. I also experienced extreme itching after radiotherapy. Not in the radiated area, but on the chest, midriff, inside of the wrists and lower legs. A visit to the GP and a 2% cortisone cream and an antihistamine helped settle it down, but I was desperate for a while. Especially in the middle of the night!',\n",
       " \"Cancer sent me into a state of depression. And it took more than a year of counseling and treatment with an anti-depressant to bring me back to a balanced and healthy level of functioning.My type of depression -- the kind that shows up just after a cancer diagnosis -- is not uncommon. And neither is the spillover that depression can leave on the children of moms depressed because of their disease.A study at the University of Pittsburgh -- the first to examine the relationship between children's concerns and a mother's cancer-related depression -- found children of depressed breast cancer patients were more likely to be concerned or anxious about their mother's cancer and about how the disease affects their families.It's not surprising that kids worry about their moms during times of illness. What startled researchers, though, is the fact that children's' anxieties extended to concerns about the entire family.The results of this study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, has clear implications. As a society, we need to think about how depression affects whole family units. Oncologists must learn to spot depression early and must swiftly assist women in finding appropriate treatment. And parents should talk openly about cancer and it's emotional side effects with their children in an effort to protect them from withdrawing, hiding their concerns, and suffering in silence.Most estimates indicate nearly one quarter of women diagnosed with breast cancer have young children. And about 100,000 kids will be affected by a cancer diagnosis this year alone. Comments: 1. Congratulations on being both a cancer and depression survivor.

And some believe doctors might not be able to cope with the increasing burden.It's the increase in cancer diagnoses, the growth in the number of Americans over the age of 65, and higher cancer survival rates due to early detection and better treatments that together will cause a shortage of doctors and nurses to care for so many sick people. In addition, more than half of medical oncologists are older than 65 and could retire soon. And while there are more than enough younger doctors to replace these retirees, they still won't be able to keep up with the demand. By 2020, the country could be short 4,000 cancer specialists.

Others loved it. We were cool. We thought so, anyway.We don\\'t think we are so cool now, however. We are happy, with our two children, our dented and dirty Honda Odyssey mini-van, and all the gear -- books, toys, wet wipes, a scooter, a Big Wheel, and even a little potty -- that fills the vast space of our latest vehicle. But I am not sure anyone would ever call us cool as we cruise around town in our family ride.My husband, John, dreams of getting another Mustang. And he\\'s primed our three-year-old son for the same dream. Danny can spot a Mustang a mile away, regardless of its year, its color, or its condition. He loves a rag-top. He prefers yellow. And he promises to buy his daddy a black Mustang as soon as he wins the lottery.I told John last night that Ford is about to release a new Mustang, with both the exterior paint and interior stitching trimmed in pink. \"Let\\'s get it,\" John said, without hesitation. He isn\\'t worried he\\'ll look less than macho in a pink Mustang. He just wants one. And while his intentions faded a bit when he learned Ford will offer only V6 models, he still thinks a pink pony car is a cool concept.Not everyone likes the idea of a Mustang marketed at women, says analyst Erich Merkle of IRN Inc. in Grand Rapids who adds that the Mustang is an iconic brand based on a special mix of speed and testosterone. Ford should not mess with success, he believes.But Ford expects its Warriors in Pink trim package, slated to release this summer, to be nothing short of a success -- in more ways than one.A portion of Mustang profits will be donated to Susan G. Komen for the Cure for breast cancer research. Ford has long been a sponsor of this organization and over the years has donated $87 million. In addition, the pink initiative could attract new buyers to the car, marked by slipping sales in recent months.While all details have not been released, the newest Mustang will be available in a few colors, and customers will have the choice of convertible or hardtop.

But still, there's a concern looming in the air -- for her and for me.I spoke with my oncologist about this concern, and he told me anything suspicious must be pursued by further testing.

This is scary -- because the number of women old enough to get screened is increasing.Women may be missing out on all sorts of necessary medical care because of inadequate health insurance or other access problems.Women may be choosing, for whatever reasons, not to get mammograms, despite strong public urging that women age 40 and older get screened one time every year.And now think about this:Recent news about declining breast cancer rates may not be all that good. It may not be that fewer women are developing breast cancer. It may simply be that fewer women are getting early diagnoses because of irregular or nonexistent screening. Comments: ',\n",

So they ask that while they are rallying in DC that you lend your support with a few simple phone calls.On Tuesday, March 20, between the hours of 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, pick up your phone and call two Senators and one Representative. Tell them now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of the cancer cause.C3 offers a step-by-step guide for making yourself heard. The group will help you locate your specific legislators and provides a script for what to say and how to say it.\"The more people who call on March 20th and ask for Congress to make funding the war on cancer a priority, the better for us all,\" says one advocate.

       " 'The results may not be immediate but a recent study indicates that purple grape juice has long-term health benefits and can help combat major illnesses, like heart disease and cancer.A study at Glasgow University measured levels of antioxidants -- thought to have a protective effect against cancer -- in a range of popular juice drinks. Purple concord grape juice came out on top, with the highest levels and range of antioxidants. Incidentally, this juice has the same level of these compounds as Beaujolais red wine.It\\'s recommended that we add a glass of grape juice to our daily diet and count it as one of our five daily fruits and vegetables.Researchers caution, though, that studying antioxidants in the lab is different than studying their effect in the body.\"The problem is that we don\\'t know what happens when they enter the body and are dissolved,\" one researcher says. \"Obviously, eating a lot of fruit and vegetables has been shown to be good for your health, but it is not known for sure which compounds are responsible for this effect.\"Still, it\\'s not a bad idea to down that glass of juice every day -- unless, of course, you are worried about sugar content like me. Comments: 1. I have an inner ear condition known as Minieres Disease. I happened to have one of my inner ear vertigo attacks while at church. Rather than disrupt the service, I just layed down on the pew and took one of my pills, Mechlazine, to stop the spinning and nausea. An elderly lady told me after church to try drinking grape juice. This was 2 weeks ago.Amazing results! I have been able to drink the juice to prevent the attacks, and If I feel one coming on, I drink the juice and it stops it rather quickly,aprox. 2-3 ounces is enough. I am amazed and grateful for this miricle. I have cut out 9 pills a day. I have 4 prescriptions. I took 4 Valum and 4 Meclizine, and 1 prescription water pill ( which I still take)just to keep from spinning. Occasionally, I had to take a Phenegrin to stop excessive nausea and dry heaving.I do not take the Valum now. I keep the Meclazine with me just in case. I use the Welches pure 100% purple grape juice. I am experimenting on starting grapeseed extract, and redwine extract. Does anyone know anythng about this idea? Grape juice is high in calories. I also have a low thyroid. So I need to find an alternative to the juice. I have had 2 days that I drank 30 oz. in a day to stop the vertigo spells throughout the entire 24 hours.I highly suggest this if you have Meniere\\'s D. It has been a miricle for me! I pray it continues to be an effective alternative for me. I hope this may be of help to someone else. I have even been able to work in the garden and pulls weeds! This would have been impossible 2 weeks ago.Grateful',\n",

       " \"When my treatment for breast cancer was just around the corner, I asked a nurse about a dietitian on staff who I might talk to -- or a nutritionist or anyone who could help me wrap my head around eating right and staying healthy and maintaining my weight during treatment. I was told that I didn't need to talk to anyone -- that I would likely not lose any weight and would be fine. I was aware at the time that a referral to a dietitian often occurs with weight loss associated with treatment -- but it seemed that a referral for merely staying on track was just as important. Yet this seemed not to be an issue.&nbsp; And I never was referred to anyone. So I found someone on my own -- and independent nutritionist who came to my house just after my first dose of chemotherapy, on a day when I felt nauseated and foggy and sick. It was a perfect time to talk to someone about how to eat during this difficult time, and the wisdom that was shared with me is as fresh in my mind today as it was 18 months ago -- when I sat at my dining room table with my mom and a young woman who knew exactly what I wanted to know.I learned that cancer patients do frequently experience weight loss -- this can be associated with the disease itself or with nutrition-related problems such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea. But some patients -- like breast cancer patients -- can gain weight. Either way, a nutritious diet is vital for maintaining a healthy weight -- and it's vital for the body to work at its best. So I learned that I should eat a variety of foods every day. And that I should eat small portions. And that I should not make any major changes to my eating regime during treatment -- because if a health concern surfaced, it would be unclear whether the cause of the concern was my diet or my disease. So my safest course of action was to maintain my normal eating habits during treatment -- and to make changes, if desired, at a later time. I still don't know if I want to change my diet. I wonder about a diet without red meat. And a vegetarian diet. And a vegan diet. I wonder about consuming dairy and the value of canned foods and how to identify hormone-treated foods.&nbsp; I wonder how -- or if -- I will change my diet once my treatment ends in July. There is one thing I know for sure, though. Seeking professional advice about diet and nutrition is important for everyone -- not just for those who might or do lose weight. For everyone. Everyone who wants to move consciously in the direction of health. Everyone who wants to take control during a time when life seems uncontrollable. Everyone. Comments: 1. Interesting! Why do they think people going through chemo for breast cancer gain weight?2. I think that the weight gain can arise for several reasons.Firstly - many women are very fatigued during chemotherapy or radiotherapy and simply burn off less calories than they normally would. Secondly - some of us (men and women) are guilty of comfort eating when stressed and when the chemo effects wear off the hunger pangs kick in.Thirdly - many hospitals give women high doses of steroids along with the chemotherapy. This partly depends on the type of chemo you're having but it's used to lessen the nausea and reduce the risk of severe vomiting. Steroids are well known to provoke weight gain due to increased appetite and also due to fluid retention.Jackie's advice about getting help from a dietician is excellent.\",\n",
       " 'Research indicates that young breast cancer survivors have a harder time recovering emotionally from cancer than women who develop the disease later in life.In Australia, a quality of life survey including 300 women found most survivors adjusted normally within 18 months after diagnosis. But women under the age of 50 reported more of a struggle with their emotional health.Perhaps it\\'s the direct threat to her life, or her fertility, or her sexuality, or her body image that brings on the added challenge for a young woman. Regardless, there are no easy solutions or quick remedies for lightening the load that weighs heavily on young minds.Breast cancer changes everything, and bouncing back from the disease takes time. And this research validates the need for programs targeted at younger women, as well as further research to more clearly identify how to better help breast cancer\\'s youngest victims. Comments: 1. We usually associate major illnesses with aging. Getting cancer while young must really amplify the \"why me\" factor. And while it gives survivors more time to live beyond the illness, it also gives them more time to deal with the physical, emotional and financial complications that cancer can engender. And that can definitely change your emotional landscape.Love to all,Richard Day Gore2. I am a young cancer survivor. I was diagnosed at the age of 32 with two you children under the age of four. Many of my fears and emotional distress came from the reality I might not be here to raise my children. I continue to struggle with this notion and it weighs heavily on my mind.Dana Whiting',\n",
       " \"If you are trying to ward off cancer by making a change in your smoking habits, cutting back isn't enough.

       " 'My friend -- who has a friend newly diagnosed with brain cancer -- greeted me at the door the other day and asked with a sense of urgency, \"How can I help?\" \"Help your friend?\" I asked.\"Yes, she said, unsure of what she might say or do in this time of great difficulty for everyone involved.I told her a few things. And then I thought of some more. It wasn\\'t terribly easy to come up with these ideas. Because even though I myself was on the receiving end of help during my cancer journey, it\\'s still hard to imagine what an individual wants or needs -- or doesn\\'t want or need. But here\\'s what I\\'ve got to offer. I hope this helps my friend. I hope it helps you too.   Allow your loved one to take the lead. If you sense this person wants to   talk, then talk. If you sense talk is not welcomed, then don\\'t talk. To   determine whether or not your friend or family member wants to discuss cancer,   approach the topic and judge the response you get. I know I can usually tell   if someone is willing to open up -- typically the conversation just flows --   and when someone is putting the brakes on chit-chat -- typically the   conversation falls flat.   If talk is not in the cards, then consider an offer of food. Sometimes   actions speak much louder than words. So think about calling a restaurant in   your friend\\'s town and ordering a meal to be delivered right to the door. Most   eating establishments accept credit card numbers over the phone so location   should be a non-issue. Even those deep in despair need to eat, and taking away   the chore of cooking and cleaning up can be quite a gift.   If the gift of food is not up your alley, how about sending a small gift,   like a candle, a pair of cozy socks, a grocery store gift card, a music CD, a   gift certificate for a spa. You name it, your special something might brighten   the day.   If you live near your loved one and have some free time, offer to drive to   appointments, visit during treatments, pick up kids and entertain them for the   day, clean house, cook, and clean up dinner. Try to be very specific with your   offers. Say, \"I\\'d like to pick up your kids tomorrow at lunch so you can take   a nap\" or \"I\\'m coming over on Sunday to rake leaves.\" These offers are easier   to accept than the \"call me if you need anything\" kind.   If a quick stop at your loved one\\'s house is possible, drop off a book on   the front porch or set some pretty potted flowers by the door. Or do both.   Then walk away without saying a word. Let your help take your friend by   surprise.   When you do have the chance to talk, avoid guiding the conversation with   your own thoughts and advice, unless requested. Saying, \"Everything will be   OK,\" for example, may not be true. Assuring your friend she will sail right   through chemotherapy may backfire if nausea and fatigue are just down the   road. Stating, \"it\\'s OK, your hair will grow back,\" doesn\\'t really help those   living with the horror of hair loss. So stay away from promises and   predictions and stick to the present. Ask questions, listen, and paraphrase   back what your friend has shared. These are basic counseling techniques. The   premise is that allowing the person to work through the issues is more   important than what we can do to directly help.   Don\\'t forget about the good old greeting card or short note that lets your   loved know how much you care. Let the card say it if you wish to avoid writing   and then add an address, a stamp, and send your support on its way.   This makes eight -- so much for sticking to my Sunday plan -- but I must   share this too: Don\\'t forget about your loved one after months and even years   pass by. Initial diagnoses are tough and treatments are tough too. But as your   friend survives each day, remember to check in. Cancer is a life-long battle   for many. Support and assistance may be just as valuable a year down the road   as it is on day one.  Comments: 1. I\\'m so happy your tests showed no further cause for concern. Had my fingers crossed for you. One of the things I asked my friends to do was to screen books and movies for me and recommend good ones that were free of breast-cancer deaths--there are a surprising number that use cancer fatalities as convenient plot devices, and I seemed to have knack for inadvertently picking them. 2. Everything you\\'ve mentioned is wise and so true. At times it is very difficult for me to stand back. I want so much to do everything in my power to help in any and every way possible, not realizing, I might not be allowing them enough space. Some people need constant reassurance, where as others prefer to pretty much be left alone.I myself, not having much support from friends or family throughout my life, left alone, through my disease, find an endless need to give to others in ways I\\'d wished others had cared and given to me. Just receiving a card would have brought a tear of joy, looking forward to the next day.Which brings me back to probably being over whelming at times, giving too much, not really allowing them the time they needed for themselves. I stand guilty. But, with a big heart! My friends lost their battle with cancer, as I have mentioned before. I was by their side when they left this world. Of that I have no regret. If I could have done things differently, it would probably have been to give them more time to themselves. Being selfish, I just did not want to lose one precious moment. However I did sense at times, when to just be quiet.You are right, a survivor will go through life altering changes. Some may come out very bitter, not wanting anyone, anything, from anybody. Others might give back 110%, not being able to give enough, and welcoming gifts, cards, flowers, dinners, just a phone call. Either way they are not to be judged, as no one person should be.A survivor is always going to wonder, is this just temporary or do I have to face this dreaded experience again!I hope it is not wrong to believe in the power of positive thinking, or prayer. My heart hurts for those with cancer and other diseases who have such a fight ahead of them. I have tried not to give false hope, just faith.Sorry this was so lengthy, it just hit home. Thanks for this article, it may help many to understand the wants and needs of our cancer victims.Sincerely, Take care all! Jason ',\n",

       " 'Simply being female puts all women at risk for breast cancer. That and age, race, family history, personal history, genetic make-up, when they had children, when they reach menopause, and a whole host of other possible factors.Now U.S. doctors are officially calling body mass index, breast density, and alcohol consumption predictors of the disease, says Therese Bevers, medical director of the Cancer Prevention Center, at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.Bevers helped write updated guidelines for the prevention of breast cancer and presented them at the 12th annual National Comprehensive Cancer Network in Hollywood, Florida on Friday. The guidelines, featuring the revised list of risk factors, also offer treatment options for women -- including bilateral mastectomy for women who have tested positive for the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 as well as possible medical treatments with drugs such as tamoxifen and raloxifene. Comments: 1. Adding in these additional risk factors for breast cancer is encouraging. Women cannot control their family history or age, but can try to maintain a body mass index less than 25, and limit alcohol intake to less than one drink per day. I was surprised that nothing was mentioned about chest x-rays in girls. It was found that girls with a genetic predisposition to breast cancer were four times more likely to develop breast cancer if they had chest x-rays prior to age 20. Though many chest x-rays are necessary, from time spent in private practice, some of these could perhaps be delayed.Lynne Eldridge M.D.Author, \"Avoiding Cancer One Day At A Time\"<A href=\"http://www.avoidcancernow.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.avoidcancernow.com/</A>',\n",

       " 'I confess. I was once a sun worshiper. I grew up in Ohio where a really sunny day was rare -- so on the occasion when the sun was bright and hot, I was in my back yard or at a swimming pool or at a lake soaking up the warmth and comfort of the rays that mostly burned my skin but gave me a glow that eventually turned the slightest shade of tan and made me feel healthy. It\\'s ironic really -- that I felt healthy when the act of sunbathing is so completely damaging. And I knew this at the time and for the many years that followed -- and I still basked in the sun and vacationed in Florida and sometimes actually drove in the direction of the sun on a overcast day, in search of a tan that was never fully achieved because my skin is pale and fair and was never meant for any amount of sun exposure.My grandma worried about me for a long time. She cautioned me and warned me because she had been cut and frozen and bandaged on many occasions for skin cancer -- after years of working on a farm and then in a garden -- and she feared that I would follow a similar path. She spoke from experience. And I didn\\'t listen. I kept after the sun and visited tanning beds too and only stopped my endless search for the sun after having a baby and then another baby -- and only then because I didn\\'t have time to spend in the sun anymore. Having children saved me -- or maybe not.The damage to my skin probably occurred long ago, well before children arrived. And I may be just waiting for the inevitable -- skin cancer -- to&nbsp; smack me in the face for my crazy behavior. I can\\'t go back and change what I did in my younger years. But I can make wise choices now.The worst burn I\\'ve suffered in the recent past has come from the rays of radiation for breast cancer. And I have no desire or plan for further damaging my skin. I am now the mom at the neighborhood swimming pool who sits on the lounge chair in the shade. I go to a dermatologist every year for a skin cancer screening, and I schedule an appointment for any bump, lump, or spot that worries me. I am happy with my skin tone and color and don\\'t dream about a tan or wish for a healthy glow. Instead I panic about my two blond little boys with pale skin, and I slather them from head to toe with sunscreen whenever we head outdoors in our sunny state of Florida -- because I see for them a future like my grandma saw for me. And if I can educate them now about how harmful the sun\\'s rays can be, perhaps I can save them from ever looking back with regret -- from ever wondering why so much time was spent in reckless pursuit of something so temporary, so unimportant, so unhealthy. Comments: 1. wow, thanks for this post, jacki! when i was in my \"care-way-too-much-about-how-i-look\" years (though isn\\'t that a woman\\'s entire lifetime?!?!) - i was a huge sun worshipper. i would do exactly as you did, laying out every chance i got, and *gasp!* for about a year and a half, i was so self-conscious about being tanned, that i visited the tanning salong twice a week, religiously. and that was with my father even being a cancer physician! he would always warn me about the daners of cancer, telling us to use sunscreen, wear hats/visors, stay in the shade. he would continually tell me that tanning doesn\\'t MAYBE lead to skin cancer, but IT WILL lead to it. i ignored him, because there was no immediate, real harmful, dangerous effect from the sun. sunburn? yes, it hurts. cancer? yeah, right.i am lucky now, as i have not yet developed it, but i fear the day that my dermatologist will have to tell me that i have some suspicious spots on my back or shoulders.and now, i am palepalepale as can be, and though i don\\'t have a radiant glow like many others around me, i use sunscreen every day on facial products, and everywhere else when i know i\\'ll be out under the sun shopping, etc. it has been a hard change in my mentality - that fair, un-tanned skin is as beautiful, and certainly \"healthier,\" than being a golden goddess (i live in LA, so it\\'s even tougher to ignore tanning).and i know it\\'s hard to convince others, especially children, that sunscreen is important. i feel like a nagging mother when i ask my friends to make sure to use sunscreen when they\\'re out on the beach, but i can\\'t help it. i have found though, that oftentimes, the reason they don\\'t use it is inconvenience and discomfort - they forget to carry it around, and it feels \"gross\" - SO i bought them ALL spray on spf 30 sport (which is easy since it\\'s a spray, AND does not feel greasy) to put in their glove boxes.

Hoping it cures my skin cancer and put an end to my worries as I still have some areas that needs to be checked.Right now it\\'s me, my sunscreen, and my Curaderm Cream.',\n",
       " 'In April, I\\'m headed to Canyon Ranch, the world\\'s most renowned health and wellness destination. In addition to day spas and residential communities in various U.S. cities, there are two resort locations -- one in Tucson, Arizona and one in Lenox, Massachusetts. This is the one I will visit.My several-day stay at Canyon Ranch comes with a bit of a breast cancer twist, and I\\'ll tell you all about it in a future post. But right now, I want to offer up a few healthy living tips offered by the professionals at these luxurious getaways. Featured on the company\\'s website, these tips might just get you motivated in a healthful direction. Breathe Proper, natural breathing can improve relaxation. When breathing deeply, imagine the new supply of oxygen flowing through your body. Remember to exhale slowly. This can help relax your body further. Breathing should never feel forced or unnatural.Just DuckyIf you\\'re looking for a quick lunchtime workout that leaves you office-ready or a convenient exercise routine that allows you to be good to go at a moment\\'s notice, jump into the nearest swimming pool. Carolyn Collman, M.S., exercise physiologist and aquatic therapist at Canyon Ranch in Tucson, says you can get in the swim without getting soaked. \"Water exercises are the perfect solution for a high-efficiency, no-hassle workout for almost everyone. An older adult new to exercise or a sedentary person can benefit from it as much as an Olympic athlete and everyone in between,\" she says.Fat-Free Isn\\'t Sugar-FreeMany foods marketed as fat-free and low-fat are loaded with sugar. Learn to read food labels to determine whether the fat-free choice is really a healthy choice. Many products are replacing partially hydrogenated oils with sugar to compensate for lost flavor. The average person consumes twenty teaspoons of added sugar a day â\\x80\\x93 that\\'s 156 pounds a year!You Are How Much You Eat A recent study by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has confirmed what Canyon Ranch has espoused for years: portion size directly impacts your weight. Using scales, measuring cups and spoons is a useful way of learning what a proper portion looks like. You can also use these common objects to help you visualize healthy portion sizes:   Palm of your hand or deck of cards for a portion of lean meat,   chicken, or fish   One-inch cube (dice) for the portion of cheese     D-cell battery for a portion of dried fruit or salad dressing     Tennis ball for rice or potatoes     Large marshmallow for salad dressing     Ping-pong ball for the serving of nuts or nut   butter There\\'s more where these came from. Go see for yourself. Or stop back here -- I promise to share more.  Comments: 1. Thank you for the health tips. We can never get enough of that. Myself, the most difficult is breathing correctly, as I suffer from asthma as well. Between inhalers and nebulizers and NOT SMOKING, I manage, wish it would just come easier.Canyon Ranch sounds wonderful. It sounds as though you\\'ll be getting some individualized attention. You\\'re going there, does it have something to do with your recent visit to the oncologist? Well, if it does, I know you\\'ll be getting the physical attention you need, and some special time for yourself. I look forward to hearing all about this magical place on your return.Thanks for the info,Take care all!Sincerely, Jason',\n",
       " 'Oh no. I think I \\'m headed for melanoma. At the very least, I seem to have a very high risk for developing the disease, thanks to my once-stubborn pursuit of a silly tan.Think about this:A review of seven different studies concludes that using a tanning bed under the age of 35 -- I\\'m so guilty -- can increase the risk of melanoma by 75 percent. Even those who have ever used indoor tanning were 15 percent more likely to develop the disease.We\\'re talking the deadliest form of skin cancer here. So deadly some experts are recommending strong measures to restrict the use of tanning beds by young people. Adults should be discouraged from tanning, some say, but access should be limited for those under the age of 18. New Jersey already has regulations in place -- those under 14 are banned from tanning salons and anyone between 14 and 18 must have parental consent.If I could turn back time, I would listen to my grandma. She told me the sun -- and tanning beds too -- were no good. But I was young. And I didn\\'t care. Now I\\'m older. And I care. But it may be too late. It seems this could be one lesson I learn the hard way. Comments: 1. I have melanoma. I was diagnosed last August and have had 6 surgeries in 6 months. I have lost 4 members in my melanoma support group. I go to Jaime\\'s funeral tomorrow afternoon. She was 29 years old. Heather was 37 when she died on March 2, 2007. The midwife noticed a suspicious mole on her leg during the birth of her 4th child. She died 23 months later. Jan was a mother of 5 ages 9 to 19, she passed away on February 8, 2007. Ceri was only 20 years old when melanoma claimed her life on January 14, 2007. I always thought skin cancer had to be HUGE, ugly, and hard to ignore. I didn\\'t know it could be small, have no symptoms, and KILL you. Melanoma incidence is increasing faster than any other cancer. According to statistics found on the American Cancer Society\\'s website (www.cancer.org), the prognosis for someone diagnosed with melanoma is worse, stage for stage, than someone with breast cancer. Getting more than 3 blistering sunburns during childhood doubles your risk. Sunbed use increases ones risk. Having fair skin and light eyes also puts you at a higher than average risk, but having dark skin does not make you immune. Bob Marley died from Melanoma in 1981. Everyone at higher risk should get screened by a dermatologist every year. And all of us should be checking our own skin each month. Melanoma is a virulent and aggressive cancer. It begins in the melanocytes, or the pigment in the skin. It presents itself as a change in an existing mole or skin pigment, or in the formation of a new one. It is easily treated in its most early stages. Once it spreads, though, it is often fatal. Unfortunately, there is no cure for melanoma. Melanoma is one of the cancers that wonâ\\x80\\x99t respond to conventional chemotherapy. There have been no significant advances in the medical treatment or survival rate in the last 30 years. More awareness is needed. Most think â\\x80\\x98itâ\\x80\\x99s only skin cancerâ\\x80\\x99, and consider it nothing serious. But I can tell you with absolute certainty, they are DEAD wrong.2. In an age of increased cancer awareness, it\\'s disheartening to see so many tanning salons opening up, seemingly everywhere. What fool invented the oxymoronic phrase \"a healthy tan\"? Richard Day Gore3. Thanks for this post! I think we need to listen to what our grandparents did half a decade ago. In 1935 the incidence of melanoma was one in 1500. This was before sunscreen! The incidence is now an alarming one in 84 Americans. I am not suggesting abandoning the sunscreen, but we need to relook at the measures that protected our ancestors. The stayed out of the sun between 11AM and 3PM. They used protective clothing, hats, and umbrellas. Keep applying the sunscreen, but don\\'t depend on it. Sunscreen has not be conclusively shown to prevent melanomas, and the false security it provides, may cause us to stay in the sun long after we should have sought shelter. Thanks, and my prayers are with your commentor. I am proud she can stand up after all of those surgeries to raise awareness!Lynne Eldridge M.D.Author, \"Avoiding Cancer One Day At A Time\"<A href=\"http://www.avoidcancernow.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.avoidcancernow.com/</A>',\n",

And while Karl received chemotherapy to kill off any lingering cancer cells, he must undergo cancer surgery once again.Karl, who plans to play in the NABC All-Star game in Atlanta on March 31, will return to Boise on April 2 for surgery to remove cancerous lymph nodes.The lymph node cancer was identified in January, but Karl, 23, kept his condition private until his team lost to New Mexico State in the Western Athletic Conference tournament semifinals. This ended the Broncos' season. And now begins Karl's second go-round with cancer.You may remember Karl as one of last year's NBA draft hopefuls.

       " 'One man. One cancer diagnosis. One feature-length film. About how 17,000 men gain membership every month in a group this one man calls, The Men\\'s Club.The man is Rocky Galgano. He is 58 years old. He is a retired police officer. And he happens to be a member of the very club he features in his film -- a club full of men living with prostate cancer.Galgano created his documentary as a companion to all the densely-written books and resources he found filled to the brim with medical jargon about a disease that will strike 218,890 and kill 27,050 men this year alone.Men are reluctant to talk about prostate cancer or get tested for the disease, says Galgano. And yet this form of cancer can be cured if caught early. So Galgano stepped to the plate and started talking. He talks about his personal experience, and he talks about different types of treatment. He has nine different doctors talk. He has cancer survivors talk. And he says he wants as many people as possible to see this film.Galgano is working on distribution and says he\\'s close to a deal with Amazon.com. He also plans to market the not-yet-rated film to urologists across the country, and he will soon sell his masterpiece -- a trailer can be seen here -- on his website for $19.95. Comments: 1. I\\'d be very interested in the film -- and as someone recently diagnosed with prostate cancer, have been thinking about writing about my own experiences. These include meeting with several of the very best doctors in the field (including Dr. Ballentine at Johns Hopkins, top open surgery doctor, Dr. Ling Su at Hopkins, who does robotics there, Dr. Mani Menon at the Vattikuti Institute in Detroit, who introduced Da Vinci surgery to the US, and am meeting this week with Dr. John Sylvester at the Seattle Prostate Institute, who, along with Dr. Peter Grimm, also at Seattle, and Dr. Michael Zelefsky at Sloane Kettering Cancer Center, seem to be the leaders in brachytherapy. I would be pleased to share my experiences and conclusions if anyone is interested.2. Adam,You have certainly consulted some of the well-known, highly respected doctors and have racked up some frequent flyer miles doing it! I admire what you are doing to become an empowered patient.Here are some ideas on other experts and on sharing what you are learning. I am a seven year survivor, and I too have a strong drive to share what I have learned.In addition to Dr. Carter, there are a number of other surgeons with sterling reputations. To name a few, starting with colleagues of Dr. Carter at Johns Hopkins, Drs. Patrick Walsh and Allen Partin, Dr. Peter Scardino of Memorial Sloan Kettering, and Dr. William Catalona, now from Northwestern. In robotic surgeon, Dr. Tewari of New York Presbyterian Hospital and Dr. Krongrad in Florida would be on my short list. For brachytherapy, Dr. Michael Dattoli of Sarasota could certainly contend for top honors, and Dr. Critz of the Radiation Clinics of Georgia would certainly also throw his hat in. Like the Seattle brachytherapy team, Dr. Dattoli has described his approach in a book for patients. (He collaborated with them on a text for doctors.)Dr. Carter is also well-known for leading one of several clinical trials that are proving that deferred therapy is often a reasonable option for low-risk men, especially men in their seventies. If your case is low risk and you would not mind sharing your experience, I would like to know if he discussed that option with you and what he said. (He spoke about that trial at our National Convention on Prostate Cancer 2005 in Washington, DC.)It is most helpful to have new and energetic patients like you share what they are learning.

       " 'OK, we all know young women get breast cancer. But the way some talk about the pair -- young women and the deadly disease -- it would seem finding a young one living with this type of cancer is like locating that needle in a haystack. Many a young woman -- like me -- have heard doctors and nurses and technicians and family and friends remark, \"you are too young for the disease,\" and then dismiss cancer suspicions as needless worry.The median age for women diagnosed with breast cancer is 65. But think about this fact, published in the Spring/Summer edition of Beyond: Live &amp; Thrive After Breast Cancer.More than 240,000 women in the United States age 40 and under are living with breast cancer. Each year in this country, more than 14,000 women 40 years old and younger are diagnosed with breast cancer, says Boston oncologist Ann Partridge, M.D., of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.That\\'s a lot of young women. That\\'s a lot of breast cancer. And yet, mammograms still are not recommended for women under the age of 40. Comments: 1. I just found this blog today and it turns out Ann is my oncologist (she rocks!!). As a 33 yr old with newly diagnosed breast cancer, I am TIRED of hearing I\\'m too young. My insurance wouldn\\'t even have paid for me to get a base line mammogram until I was 40. How many young people are willing to fork over the cash for something society and insurance companies tell them they don\\'t need?2. I was diagnosed last October at age 33. My breast cancer is hereditary -- my mom was diagnosed (and survived) at age 35. My insurance did pay for mammograms but in my case it didn\\'t work.

We are in best case senario as far as her diagnosis goes but it is still a very difficult time for us as you well know. It\\'s a great thing when people of your stature come forward from the begining to help make people aware of diseases, but your courage is overwhelming to me and thousands of others. Our family has been a fan a of UCONN atheletics since forever as we only live 20 mins from campus and have a son persuing a career in atheletic training there. We will watch the game tonight intently and hope for the best game possible. The outcome, win or lose cetainly won\\'t be as important as the battle you face every day, but on this night the outcome for me will not determine the best team, only one of the most courageous people I\\'ve ever had the pleasure to know from afar. Good luck tonight, good luck in life. You are in our thoughts and prayers.The StMartin Family2.

New Way to Assess Treatment for Metastatic Disease<A href=\"http://www.breastcancer.org/cell_search_mets.html\" rel=nofollow>http://www.breastcancer.org/cell_search_mets.html</A>New Test Offers Faster Way to Assess Treatment for Metastatic Breast CancerM. Cristofanilli et al., New England Journal of Medicine, August 19, 2004In recent years, great advances have been made in treating metastatic breast cancer. More treatments are available now than ever before, and many more women are able to live for years with metastatic disease.Yet with so many treatment options, it\\'s sometimes hard to know which one to choose, and whether to continue with what you\\'re on or switch to something else. How well is the treatment working to stop or slow down the cancer? Does the treatment cause side effects that are draining your quality of life? The bottom line is always this: Do the benefits outweigh the side effects?To get answers to these questions, women with metastatic breast cancer typically have to wait two or three months after starting a new treatment. Only then can doctors order the tests (blood work, x-rays, scans, etc.) that will show whether the cancer has improved, stayed the same, or progressed.If you could learn more quickly how effective your treatment is, you could make better treatment decisions. If the treatment is working, you\\'d stick with it. If it\\'s not doing the job, you could stop the current therapy and try another treatment that might work better.Switching sooner rather than later might boost the chances that the new treatment would be more successful. And if you\\'re bothered by the side effects of a treatment, knowing right away that it\\'s working might make it easier to tolerate. Or, if a test showed the treatment wasn\\'t working, you could feel more at peace with the decision to stop it.A new test called CellSearch can show how well a treatment for metastatic disease is working just three to four weeks after the treatment begins. The test counts how many cancer cells are in a sample of your blood before treatment and a few weeks after you start taking it. If the number stays the same or goes up after treatment, then the treatment probably isn\\'t working. If the number goes down, the treatment is probably doing a good job slowing down the cancer.It\\'s important to note that cancer cells can sometimes be detected in the bloodstream even in women before surgery, whose tests show only cancer in the breast with or without lymph node involvement. Cancer cells circulating in the blood may be harmless if they are unable to grow and just die off. Or the cancer cells may be able to land elsewhere in the body, form a metastatic deposit, grow, and cause problems. In women with metastatic disease, there is a higher chance that cancer cells can be found in the blood.The new CellSearch test offers hope that women with metastatic breast cancer will be able to decide more quickly whether or not to continue with a particular treatment, depending on how well it is working for them. But researchers need to do more studies with larger numbers of women with metastatic breast diseaseâ\\x80\\x94as well as women with early-stage breast cancerâ\\x80\\x94to determine how accurate CellSearch, and other tests like it, are.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the CellSearch test in January 2004. But it still isn\\'t widely available. If you\\'re interested, talk to your doctor about enrolling in a clinical trial for this or other systems that can help you find the best treatments for YOU. You might also consider joining the BCMETS mailing list. This is a large international email discussion list on which women with metastatic breast cancer and their partners discuss treatment and offer support.

First-in-Class Test Can Predict Progression-Free and Overall Survival of Patients with Metastatic Breast CancerSimple blood test may help doctors make critical treatment decisions earlierWARREN, N.J., Aug. 18 (HSMN NewsFeed) -- Veridex, LLC, a Johnson &amp; Johnson company, today announced that The New England Journal of Medicine (351; 781-791, 2004, August 19) published the results of a prospective study showing that the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in 7.5mL of blood taken from women with metastatic breast cancer can predict progression-free and overall survival. CTCs are cancer cells that detach from solid tumors and enter the bloodstream. Knowing the number of CTCs in the blood may pave the way for oncologists to make critical decisions about patients\\' treatment earlier than previously possible.The multi-institutional, double-blind trial used the Veridex CellSearch(TM) System, a diagnostic technology that is the first of its class to automate the detection and enumeration of CTCs. The CellSearch(TM) System was cleared according to the FDA \"de novo\" classification process whereby the test was first determined to be safe and effective, then listed with the U.S. Federal Register as a new device. It is expected to become commercially available in the fall of 2004.The study enrolled 177 metastatic breast cancer patients who were about to either start initial therapy or change to a new course of therapy. Patients were tested for a CTC count before therapy, and then again at the first follow-up approximately three to four weeks later. Patients with five or more CTCs per 7.5mL (the equivalent of one blood draw) ultimately had significantly shorter progression-free survival and overall survival than patients with fewer than five CTCs. Further, the percentage of patients with more than 5 CTCs was reduced from 49 percent (87 women) to just 30 percent (49 women) at first follow up -- an indication that a number of patients responded to therapy.\"The results showed the presence of circulating tumor cells to be the strongest independent predictor of progression-free and overall survival,\" said lead author Massimo Cristofanilli, M.D., Associate Professor in the Department of Breast Medical Oncology at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.While CTCs have been documented since 1869, and discussed in over 1,500 publications, the technology has not been available until now to fully understand their value.\"For the first time, oncologists now have a powerful diagnostic tool, designed for mainstream clinical practice, that automates and standardizes the collection and detection of CTCs,\" said Robert T. McCormack, Ph.D., general manager, cellular diagnostics, Veridex. \"The CellSearch(TM) System addresses a significant unmet need by providing more accurate information -- earlier than ever before possible -- to enable more informed treatment decisions. It is important to note that the CellSearch(TM) test is not for use with early breast cancer or for screening purposes.\"Currently patients go through several rounds of treatment before it is known whether or not the therapy is working. According to Daniel F. Hayes, M.D., Clinical Director of the Breast Oncology Program at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center and the study\\'s senior author, \"One of the most problematic aspects of managing cancer is determining the fine lines dividing an effective course of therapy from one that is futile. The CellSearch(TM) System may significantly advance our ability to more accurately define those lines and more effectively manage cancer therapy; we are planning further studies to precisely define the role of monitoring CTCs in women with metastatic disease.\"Immunicon Corp. of Huntingdon Valley, PA, developed the CellSearch(TM) System under a Development, License and Supply Agreement with Veridex.Veridex, LLCVeridex, LLC, a Johnson &amp; Johnson company, develops cancer diagnostic products that will enable earlier disease detection as well as more accurate staging, monitoring and therapeutic selection.

Looking at reactions to a technology/product that can help, another lister posted this about Elizabeth Edward\\'s health.------------------------------------------Immunicon\\'s Cell Search [marketed by J&amp;J\\'s Veridex unit] would have been an ideal way to monitor her treatment.If anyone knows how to contact her, it might be worthwhile to let her and her doctors know about CellSearch. Of course, is she is being treated by Oncologists who can\\'t get their heads out of their backsides, it might not make a difference.6. Results of using the CellSearch system indicate that monitoring of circulating tumor cells can contribute to the understanding of tumor-blood interactions and may provide a valuable tool for therapy monitoring in solid tumors like breast cancer. With cells being alive in circulation, it may mean that a patient would need additional treatment.It was such a technique that German investigators from Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena were able to quantify ciculating tumor cells in a study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with three different paclitaxel (taxol) containing regimens, which showed as the tumor collapses (a clinical response, not cure), it produces the greatest release of circulating tumor cells. The study had not looked at any other combination regimens.These ciculating tumor cells can detach from solid tumors and enter the blood stream, thus beginning the process of metastasis, the most life-threatening aspect of cancer. To metastasize, or spread cancer to other sites in the body, circulating tumor cells travel through the blood and can take root in another tissue or organ (the lungs, bones, liver, adrenals, and even the brain).In the study, according to Katharina Pachmann, M.D., professor of experimental oncology and hematology, breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy gave blood samples in which epithelial antigen-positive cells were isolated. Such cells are detected in most breast cancer patients but are rarely found in normal subjects. The investigators measured the levels of cirulating tumor cells before and during primary chemotherapy with several different cytotoxic agents.Paclitaxel (taxol) produced the greatest degree of tumor shrinkage but also the greatest release of circulating tumor cells. In three different paclitaxel-containing regimens, circulating cell numbers massively increased, whereas tumor size decreased. It may indeed give clinical response (tumor shrinkage), sometimes impressive, however, these are mostly short-lived and relapses after a response to taxanes (taxol) are often dramatic.Even if one or more chemotherapy regimen is identified as being likely to work on a particular cancer, has the science advanced to tell us whether application of the chosen chemotherapy regimen will not cause other changes that also cause cancer to later return and perhaps be even harder to treat? Is it a case of chemotherapy being bad, in cases where it apparently works? Traditional chemotherapy is mutagenic (changes in form), you might kill off a whole lot of cancer, only to cause a mutation in the remaining cancer, such that the remaining cancer behaves in a more agressive fashion.This study tells us that much more work needs to be done, and oncologists need to adapt treatment to the patient. There are hundreds of chemotherapeutic agents, all of which have approximately the same probability of working. The tumors of different patients have different responses to chemotherapy. It requires individualized treatment based on testing individual properties of each patient\\'s cancer.(Oncol News Int\\'l, Vol 14, #5, May \\'05)7.

Wow! 1995! That\\'s what happens when you chase one abstract/paper after another abstract/paper. You get = one abstract/paper after another abstract/paper (and in mice).In addition to the Pachmann, et al study above, (2005) which showed that in three different taxol-containing regimens, circulating cell numbers massively increased, it has been frequently observed that patients with breast cancer treated with a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen, either in the adjuvant setting or in the metastatic setting, presented with CNS involvement as the only evidence of disease progression, according to another study. This one even more recent (2006).Central Nervous System (CNS) relapses are common among breast cancer patients treated with a taxane-based chemotherapy regimen. In this study it was possible to confirm the initial clinical observation that breast cancer patients who receive a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen have a significantly higher incidence of CNS metastases compared with that of patients treated with a nontaxane-containing regimen.The reasons for the association between treatment of breast cancer with a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen and an increased incidence of CNS involvement was that taxanes are very lipophilic, their concentration in the CNS is very low after their intravenous administration. Taxanes are unable to penetrate the intact blood-brain barrier, the concentration of radiolabeled taxol in the cerebrospinal fluid is found to be significantly lower than in other organs, and thus undetectable in the brain, in the spinal cord or in any other site of the CNS. The detection of cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) and of mRNA-positive circulating tumor cells (CTC\\'s) in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow of patients with breast cancer is correlated with increased incidence of relapse.(Breast Cancer Res. 2006;8(4)2006 BioMed Central, Ltd.) 11. Pawelski, above makes the mistake that any first year epidemiology student should not make, i.e. correlation does not equal causation. It took awhile to find the Pachmann paper but the author states that \"These cells seeded into the circulation may be the origin of the recurrences seen after taxol treatment.\"\"MAY BE\"No evidence at all. Merely a conjecture. The author could present no evidence and has not done so since the original article was published years ago.Secondly, the statement that CNS relapses occur from taxanes lacks evidence. And here you will see why Pachmann was wrong:Look at this study:<A href=\"http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/543766_4\" rel=nofollow>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/543766_4</A>It states:1. Taxanes are highly effective in breast cancer and they prolong the survival of patients with advanced disease. 2.It is also well known that CNS involvement is more frequent in the late stages of the disease.3.The increase in survival and the prolonged period of advanced disease is correlated with the increased frequency of CNS relapse.4.[The] difference in the incidence of CNS relapse between patients with breast cancer and other solid tumors could be explained by the higher efficacy of the taxanes in breast cancer which is associated with increased survival in comparison with other solid tumors.Taxanes do not emerge as an independent predictive factor for CNS metastases. So, it\\'s very evident that CNS metastases occur because patients lived longer.Correlation definitely does not equal causation.Be careful what you read on the internet. Do the research yourself. It will pay off.12. To the reader, as you may know, personal experiences should be viewed with caution. The reader knows only what the poster posts and one case certainly does not make for evidence. I read Mr. Pawelski\\'s web site. He leaves one with the impression that chemotherapy kills, not cancer. I hear this from the alternative medicine and New Age community all the time. Yet, there was, and is in 2007, no clear indication that taxanes \"feverishly\" increase cancer cells that then \"wreak havoc.\" One must look warily at those who use words like \"could explain\" in a post. Pawelski states, \"The fact that they are there, and TAXANES FEVERISHLY INCREASE THEM, is disconcerting.\" This has already been addressed in my above post, yet there is a persistence here, for whatever reason.These are highly charged words from someone who does not interpret the data the way the scientists do and no good scientist would ever use emotionally charged words like this to make a point.It is one thing to state that taxanes and other chemotherapies may not affect overall survival. It is quite another to say that they increase mortality as he continues to do.I recommend you be diligent in your research when individuals like this post to blogs. Do the same when people like myself post.And, do as I do. If it sounds emotional, call them on it. Probe. Ask for real evidence, not personal, emotional getting-it-off-your-chest information, but the real thing.I\\'m sure I\\'ll get a response to this post, but I think I\\'ve answered the taxane charge. Until there is any convincing evidence, not some opinion, I think we\\'ve tossed this one around enough.Good health to you, to those of you on taxanes.13. hchcec reminded me of a so-called oncologist at our local community hospital, who thought he had to give my wife a fifth infusion of chemotherapy into her ommaya reservoir, when after each of the prior three infusions the cytology from withdrawn CNS fluid was negative in every case. His reasoning? I read a paper once. Then I asked if he wanted to do this without any bloodwork being done. He looked up, then looked at me, and said, \"never mind.\"Drs. V. Valero and G.N. Hortobagyi, in an editorial published in the March 15, 2003 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology stated that review of all the large, prospective, randomized trials published comparing taxane-based chemotherapy regimens, concluded that none of these regimens have increased either complete response rates or overall survival.These ciculating tumor cells could explain the lack of overall survival advantage for unsuccessful or even partially successful treatment. If anything, the surviving cells would be more disregulated and therefore tougher and more aggressive, and since they no longer have to compete with the less aggressive and easier to kill cells for nutrients, all of the now even more rapidly expanding clone of tough-guy cells would be more likely to invade, metastasize, and generally wreak havoc. The fact that they are there, and taxanes feverishly increase them, is disconcerting.14. The so-called scientific community gets angry at being given information that challenges their entrenched position or they deny that opposing facts are valid. They think what they believe is the truth. Established beliefs are defended with our very lives. Upton Sinclair asserted that you can\\'t convince a man to know something that his income depends on him not acknowledging. Albert Einstein stated that the significant problems we face cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them. Perhaps hchcec\\'s significant-other shouldn\\'t be so entrenched?15. You\\'ve all made some interesting points. I am currently on docetaxol. Last treatment Apr 5.Here in this part of Canada the protocol for E+node+ adjuvant chemotherapy is FEC100 3x q3W anddocetaxol 3x q3w. They say my stage is curable:)Maybe and maybe not. It would be helpful if someone would address any causative factors because if my tumour suppressor gene has gone for coffee and not returned, who\\'s to say we can\\'t create another tumour just like it.I was terrified of chemo because of the damage it can do. Injecting a carcinogen and mutagen in myveins and being terribly ill for months does notinduce a feeling of moving towards health in mymind at least. Esp when one of the drugs can actually make your skin sizzle. What am I doing??I wish there had been another wa',\n",
       " ' than using this barbaric system, but I didn\\'t find one and time was ticking. Adjuvantonline gave me a 70% chance of recurrence.I believe firmly that what this stuff doesn\\'t kill, it only makes stronger as too often we hear of a recurrence or mets that is substantially moreaggressive than the original cancer. If it took them 7-10yrs to grow, we would all get by the 5yr. mark.I am concerned about this comment: The fact that they are there, and taxanes feverishly increase them, is disconcerting.This wouldn\\'t surprise me one bit, what annoys meis that I didn\\'t see any of that info when I was researching the chemo\\'s.At any rate it\\'s been interesting reading the bantering of the posters and very thought provoking.Thank youjan16.

For example, a blood sample that contains fewer than five CTCs may indicate a cancer that will be slower to spread; a blood sample with five or more CTCs may suggest a cancer more likely to progress quickly.Many women affected by advanced breast cancer undergo first-line, or initial, chemotherapy to treat their cancers. In most cases, women with advanced disease receive a treatment until the cancer grows (as seen by the doctor on physical exam or using imaging tests) or until the side effects impact their quality of life. Researchers hope that by measuring the CTC count before a woman begins treatment and following it over time, they may be able to determine whether the treatment is working before symptoms of progression appear.Goals of the CTC TrialThis purpose of this trial is to determine the value of CTCs and to see whether information gathered from the CellSearch test may give doctors more information about the aggressiveness of a cancer.The trial also will establish the value of regularly measuring CTC levels and will evaluate the degree to which women with and without elevated CTC levels experience treatment side effects.Structure of the TrialThis phase III trial will compare the effectiveness of choosing a course of chemotherapy based on CTC levels to the standard treatment strategy of selecting a course of chemotherapy based on disease progression.Women who enter this trial must be receiving chemotherapy for the first time for advanced breast cancer. Before the first course of chemotherapy, doctors will measure the baseline (starting) CTC levels of a 7.5ml sample of each participantâ\\x80\\x99s blood. The participants will then be divided into groups based on their results. All participants with fewer than five CTCs will be assigned to group one. Participants with five or more CTCs will have their blood levels analyzed three weeks later, after their first course of chemotherapy, and be assigned to either groups two or three:Group 1 participants will have fewer than five CTCs at the start of the trial and a low risk of early progression. They will continue to receive regular chemotherapy treatment.Group 2 participants will have fewer than five CTCs after completing one course of chemotherapy and a moderate risk of early progression. Their CTC levels will have decreased during treatment. They will continue to receive their current chemotherapy without change.Group 3 participants will have a CTC level greater than five with a high risk of early progression. They will be divided based on HER-2/neu status and disease type (metastasis to the bone versus measurable metastasis to other areas of the body) and will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:Arm 1 participants will continue to receive their current chemotherapy (the standard treatment).Arm 2 participants will receive a new chemotherapy (the treatment under study).This trial is partially randomized because only Group 3 participants are randomly assigned to certain treatments. Randomization ensures that doctors analyze results objectively and do not let their predictions influence conclusions.Participants from groups two and three will undergo blood collection throughout and at the conclusion of chemotherapy. In addition to the CellSearch test, researchers also will test each participantâ\\x80\\x99s blood sample using CA 15-3, a test measuring how well invasive breast cancers respond to treatment, and CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen), a test that measures the amount of certain protein in the blood.Can I Participate in this Trial?The researchers seek 500 participants for this trial. They will be followed five years after completion of their treatment.

       " \"There are four pages in the March 2007 Reader's Digest featuring amazing discoveries, devices, tests, and cures. And many of the snippets of information are -- yes -- somehow linked to cancer. Think about this:   A new ultrasound technique lets radiologists distinguish between   malignant and benign breast lesions. Using elasticity imaging, researchers   accurately identified harmless and cancerous lesions in almost all of the 80   cases studied. If results can be reproduced in a large trial, this technique   could significantly reduce the number of breast biopsies required.    Scientists seeking new treatment for diseases can use an online tool   developed by researchers at MIT and Harvard. The Connectivity Map matches   diseases with compatible drugs, based on the genetic profiles of both. So far,   about 160 drugs and compounds are cataloged, and a few new uses for existing   drugs have already been suggested. Eventually, all FDA-approved drugs will be   included.   For those who sometimes forget to take their pills, a new device --   that can be preloaded with up to 100 doses of medication -- could one day be   implanted in the body and programmed to administer drugs via wireless signals.   This device, successful in tests using dogs, was designed to deliver medicines   that are less effective when taken orally. Sometimes it seems cancer's grip is tightening. Other times, in the war against this pesky disease, it seems we are on the verge of something really great. Comments: \",\n",

       " \"Joey has a hard time staying in bed when we put him down for the night. When we ask him why he continually gets up, he tells us that he wants to be with us -- mommy and daddy --&nbsp; and that he wants to watch TV and that he's just not tired. He is five years old. And he will try anything to coax us into allowing him to stay up just a little bit longer. Lately, he's been asking serious questions he knows will take some time to answer -- like how exactly does a light bulb work? And how does lightening get in the air? And how do you build a house? Last night, his questions followed a medical path -- a cancer path really.Joey was almost four years old when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. He was young -- is still young -- but he knows the basics. He knows I've had cancer -- although the seriousness of it is a bit over his head -- and he knows medicine caused my hair to fall out and he knows I see the doctor over and over again and he knows I have sometimes felt not so well. He's been briefed on every step of the journey -- about my surgery, my port, my chemotherapy, my radiation. He's been prepared and informed, in a simple kind of way -- but cancer doesn't seem to phase him much. And sometimes I think this must seem a normal way of life to him, that he might think all little boys have mommies with cancer. And while he has never been outwardly affected by my cancer, he has certainly absorbed all the tidbits that have been shared with him -- and last night, all sorts of bits and pieces came tumbling out of his mouth. His goal was to avoid bedtime and to stay up later. He achieved his goal. But he also walked away with another mini lesson on the topic of cancer. He may have been just as happy with a Q &amp; A session on the existence of the solar system or the functioning of car motors. But what he got -- besides a later bedtime -- was enlightening, I think. For both him and me.Joey sat on a chair directly across from me last night when he first wandered out of his room. He curled up on a chair and said, Mommy, I want to ask you about this because I think you know a lot about it. I nodded and sighed and prepared myself for just about any line of questioning. And then he said, how do they make shots? It took me a while to determine what kind of shots he was talking about -- I don't know if he even knew at the time -- and we finally agreed on a discussion about injections. I told him about syringes and how they hold medicine and how a needle pinches the skin and how medicine goes into the body. Then he asked me, Do you remember when you had to do your breathing? My breathing. It took me a minute again to pinpoint what he meant. And then it hit me -- he remembered when I told him about the breathing I had to do during my radiation sessions. So I told him the story again -- that I had to put a tube in my mouth and had to listen for someone to tell me over a speaker to hold my breath. I told him that I would hold my breath and then someone would tell me when it was time for me to breath again. I told him that this happened a few times while big machines sent out special rays that would make me better. His response -- why didn't anyone stay in the room with you? He wondered why everyone left the room and why someone had to speak to me through a speaker. He wanted to know why I was all alone. I didn't tell him my real response -- that no one else wants to be in a room when radiation beams are bouncing all over the place -- so I told him instead that these people had to do their work in another room -- which is also true -- and Joey was happy with that. And then his last question came -- what about that metal in your body? Again,&nbsp; not entirely clear but I soon determined that he was talking about my port. He asked how it got there and I told him a doctor cut my skin, slid it in, and then sewed up my skin. He asked if it hurt and I told him that I was asleep and couldn't feel anything. He sighed, nodded, was content. He marched back to bed, was asleep moments later and has said nothing of our conversation today. These are the moments I savor -- when my initial frustration about a boy who won't stay in bed turns to pure joy about a boy who, regardless of intentions, talks to me and listens to me and hears my words. A boy who is concerned that I was alone for my radiation treatments and that I may have felt pain when my port was inserted. A boy whose lessons come at a young age and at all hours of the night -- night after night. A boy who just moments ago asked his first important question of the night --&nbsp; how does drinking water help your sickness go away? Comments: \",\n",
       " 'Elizabeth Edwards, wife of Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, has had many routine medical follow-ups since her 2004 breast cancer diagnosis. And all of them -- until just a few days ago -- resulted in what is generally termed a clean bill of health.The term doesn\\'t always come with a sense of relief for those of us surviving breast cancer -- or any cancer for that matter -- because it only really defines what our bodies are telling us at one specific moment. There are no magic blood tests, no special body scans, no conclusive ways of determining whether or not cancerous cells have gone astray and will one day surface again.I asked my oncologist after my first six-month follow-up how he would know if my cancer returns. He told me it\\'s really up to me to determine whether it comes back. It\\'s up to me to get mammograms and ultrasounds and MRIs. It\\'s up to me to report any symptoms and suspicions. It\\'s up to me to track my general well-being so that it will be clear when something feels not-so-right. If I have a persistent cough or headaches that won\\'t subside, my doctor will take action with X-rays and scans and tests. But as long as I feel fine and nothing troubling presents itself, then I remain in the clean-bill-of-health club.Edwards no longer has a clean bill of health. But she is determined to use her newest diagnosis -- stage four metastatic cancer of the bones, considered treatable but not curable -- to work toward the best health she can acquire for as long as she can hold onto it. And that is about as good as any of us can do. Comments: 1. Friends,A new Web site dedicated to Cancer, ALS and Hospice Care launched today: 3Reasons.orgThe site is for A Ride for Three Reasons. 65-year-old cancer survivor Bob Lee of Barrington, IL will ride his bike 6,500 miles across America to support Cancer, ALS and Hospice Care.Have a look at the site and feel free to contribute. We\\'ve raised over $200,000 so far and we\\'re going for $500,000.-ChrisVisit A Ride for Three Reasons2. My dear Ms. Donaldson: Put simply, and with humble due respect to all women dealing and coping with cancer, you are wrong, or perhaps I should say, your doctor is simply not keeping up and s/he is misinformed.THERE ARE BLOOD TESTS THAT COULD HAVE HELPED ELIZABETH EDWARDS KNOW IF HER CANCER HAD METASTISIZED.A CTC TEST, aka, a CellSearch test would have told her that tumor cells are shedding from the primary site.Greg P. correctly pointed out on these webpages this.Go to Veridex.com\\'s webpages and see what is going on in cancer diagnostics.TRUE, radiology isn\\'t worth a DAMN, it\\'s too late by the time you can see a tumor, HELLO, you need a cellular test, and the cellular level to give you a super quick heads-up.See the NEJM, August 2004 by MD Anderson\\'s Cristofanilli, Michigan\\'s Dan Hayes, et al. and ALL the subsequent [at least 20 papers] literature showing concurrent results.You are doing your readers A HUGE DIS-SERVICE to say there are NO methods to have gotten an early warning sign.I apologize for any harsh tone, but it\\'s Friday night, and I have watched too many women die from MBC, while luckily helping guide a few women\\'s treatment with this revolutionary CELLULAR method of diagnosing, treating, and MONITORING metastatic cancer, whether breast, prostate, or colorectal [both soon to have FDA approval]see <A href=\"http://www.immunicon.com/research/papers.html\" rel=nofollow>http://www.immunicon.com/research/papers.html</A>or <A href=\"http://veridex.com/NewsEvents.aspx?id=14&amp;type=0\" rel=nofollow>http://veridex.com/NewsEvents.aspx?id=14&amp;type=0</A>3. It has never been shown that any laboratory or radiographic test improves treatment outcome. If that is a good reason, then patients should never have any x-ray studies or laboratory tests performed, because they have never been proven to improve outcomes. This goes for estrogen receptors, DNA analysis, bacterial culture and sensitivity tests, CA-125 levels, CT scans, MRI scans, bone scans, and every other test. It even goes for the practice of making a tissue diagnosis before definitively treating the cancer.An entire generation of academic oncologists has been trained in the paradigm of the empiric, randomized trial to select the best regimen for the average patient and an entire generation of practicing oncologists have been trained to use these empiric regimens in the management of their patients. Trained to make extensive use of expensive, latest-generation radiographic tests and second-look surgeries to measure tumors before and during therapy to monitor and document \"response\" or \"progression,\" despite the absence of even a shred of evidence that such radiographic and surgical documentation does anything at all to improve outcome beyond that which could be obtained by monitoring treatment results with history, physical, and simple blood tests.Whatever benefit that may arise from the CellSearch technique will not likely happen because of the clinical investigation culture epitomized by fraternal organizations which mindlessly continues its attempts to disparage, denigrate and bury long-needed improvements in the individual management of cancer patients. However, the information is there and intellectual curiosity demands its knowledge, to whoever that appropriate person is.With the absence of effective laboratory tests to guide physicians, many patients do not even get a second chance at treatment when their disease progresses. Spending six to eight weeks to diagnose treatment failure often consumes a substantial portion of a patient\\'s remaining survival, not to mention toxicities and mutagenic effects.There are molecular and cellular tests available to weed out those cancer patients that chemotherapy wouldn\\'t have any benefit, what chemotherapy works the best for those that chemotherapy would benefit, and further monitor treatment success or disease progression. Until the controlled, randomized trial approach has delivered curative results with a high success rate, the choice of physicians to integrate promising insights and methods, remains an essential component of cancer treatment advocacy.4. I have been following the Circulating tumor cell (CTC\\'s) research for about 7 years. There seems to be little doubt that in women with metastatic breast cancer CTC\\'s need to monitored. First to prognose where the disease is going and secondly to determine if treatment is effective. The most recent work demonstrates that CTC monitoring is significantly better than radiology and can do that at earlier in the course of treatment. That will enable Oncologists to change protocols that are ineffective.The reason why Cell Search (the only CTC test I know of) is not catching on is that women are not demanding it. Why is that so? Firstly, because Oncologists are not trained to think out of the box (in surgery, e.g. you have to) and are stuck in protocol treatments. Secondly, as a retired practicioner I know that potentially terminal patients put too much faith in their physicians. Its a very natural phenomena. If you think you are going to die and you think someone can save you, its hard (maybe impossible) to be critical.5. Does anyone know how Elizabeth Edwards\\' cancer was staged initially in 2004? Was she in stage III then? I have a burning need to know this question since she and I have the \"same\" type cancer, etc. I know all C. is different, etc. but hers breast cancer was never publically reported as to its stage. Thank you.6. Most oncologists are highly trained and attempt to help cancer patients every day.CTC testing is still investigational. Let science be our guide, not emotion. Results are pending:The application of this technology has not been proven to affect outcomes in patients with metastatic cancer. There are no conclusive data to indicate that knowledge of this prognostic factor can be used to alter the therapy that is offered to patients and improve outcomes. While this testing may have potential for use in patient monitoring, there is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of this technology as a marker of disease progression. Additionally, no head-to-head trials have demonstratedthat this technology is equal to or better than any existing tumor markers in its efficacy and clinical utility.This technology has not been demonstrated to affect overall health outcomes for patients with metastatic cancer and is therefore considered experimental, investigational and unproven.<A href=\"http://www.cigna.com/customer_care/healthcare_professional/coverage_positions/medical/mm_0262_coveragepositioncriteria_circulating_tumor_cells_testing.pdf\" rel=nofollow>http://www.cigna.com/customer_care/healthcare_professional/coverage_positions/medical/mm_0262_coveragepositioncriteria_circulating_tumor_cells_testing.pdf</A>No, it\\'s not necessary to post a follow up stating that insurance companies are evil. They cover many, many proven tests. The data is just not there yet.7. The goal of oncologists is to strive for a complete remission that lasts a long time (a durable complete remission). Unfortunately, the vast majority of remissions that are achieved are partial remissions. Too often, these are measured in weeks to months and maybe, sometimes, in years. Some types of cancer do not show any meaningful response to chemotherapy.The chemotherapy regimen chosen by most conventional oncologists is based on the type of cancer being treated. However, there are factors other than the type of cancer that can be used to determine the ideal chemotherapy drugs that should be used to treat an individual patient.At present, medical oncologists prescribe chemotherapy according to \"fixed\" schedules. These schedules are standardized drug regimens that correspond to specific cancers by type or diagnosis. These schedules, developed over many years of clinical trials, assign patients to the drugs for which they have the greatest statistical probability of response.Patients with cancers that exhibit multidrug resistance will likely receive treatments that are wrong for them. A failed attempt at chemotherapy is detrimental to the physical and emotional well being of patients, is financially burdensome, and may preclude further effective therapies.Patients, physicians, insurance carriers, and the FDA are all calling for predictive tests that allow for rational and cost-effective use of chemotherapeutic drugs.8. No one is suggesting insurance companies are evil. The real issue is how Oncology as a specialty has evolved and how we train Oncologists in the US. Many of the advances have come from Europe. For example, when \"lumpectomy\" was introduced by the Italians there was ABSOLUTE disbelief within the American Oncology community. Its now routine. Why is that so? In the mid 80\\'s Soan Kettering realilzed that not one major advance had in cancer treatment orginated there. (they actually majorly changed their focus to an Immunology aproach for some years after that conclusion.) One has to ask if the Ameriacan system is training the immagination out of our Oncologists?

       " 'Advocacy runs far and wide. Thank goodness for that.Think about this:A new breast cancer non-profit organization has been launched especially for South Africans affected by the disease.Founded by Samantha Galliet, the 31-year-old breast cancer survivor who made headlines with her \"David and Goliath\" battle to get life-saving Herceptin treatment, created PinkLink to give patients affected by breast cancer a voice.PinkLink, focusing on the need for self-examination and awareness to encourage prevention and early detection of this silent epidemic, is intended to be a one-stop-shop with valuable South African based information on doctors, treatments, financial considerations, and health issues.

       " 'Elizabeth Edwards has been told the metastatic cancer found in her bones is considered stage four. And it\\'s treatable. But not curable.Tricky stuff -- all this cancer terminology -- and a little hard to fully comprehend.I saw Sheryl Crow talking with Maria Shriver and Dr. Susan Love on Larry\\'s King\\'s CNN program the other night. Crow says her breast cancer was curable -- it was teeny tiny and had not spread and required a lumpectomy and radiation, but not chemotherapy. \"I\\'m the walking poster child for early detection,\" she said. Her cancer was caught and treated swiftly. She is cured. Theoretically.Can Crow\\'s cancer still return? Yep. We just aren\\'t sure at the time of one cancer discovery if these deadly cells have drifted away from the main site and will later show up elsewhere, explained Dr. Love. All predictions would have Crow living a long life free of cancer. But they may have had Edwards in the same boat just two years ago when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer.So now Edwards\\' cancer is not curable. It is treatable. And this is a bit easier to understand. Her cancer will never go away. But doctors can keep it at bay. And Love says they can even make it better. But there is no cure for what Edwards has. So she will live with cancer for the rest of her life. I guess curable means: the cancer is gone and we hope it never comes back. And treatable means: the cancer is not gone and will never be gone but we will treat it for as long as we can. I think I get it. Comments: 1. I can buy \"curable means the cancer is gone and we hope it never comes back.\" My wife\\'s ovarian cancer in 1972 was documented on her medical records as being cured. It was always hoped that it was cured, and would never come back. It did though, twenty-four years later.The hallmark of cancer IS its heterogeneity. Not just many types of cancer, but many subtypes of cancer within a given type. The biologies are very different and the response to given drugs is very different. The heterogeneity of human cancer tells us that patients who have similar stages and grades of cancer and whose tumors have similar histologic features have a broad range of clinical outcomes. It is said that cancer is not a single genetic disease, but rather hundreds of diseases consisting of various combinations of genetic alterations.And of course, the hallmark of cancer treatment IS its heterogeneity. There are so many new drugs coming down the pike that there is simply no way to evaluate them in prospective, randomized clinical trials. All of these drugs tend to be partially effective, and even then, in only a minority of cases, and often for only a short duration of time. Tumor shrinkage should not be the criteria for approving cancer drugs. A patient responds to therapy when their tumor shrinks, but apparently this has nothing to do with survival. A tumor responds, shrinks a little, then quickly grows and spreads. The cancer comes back with a vengeance and the cancer patient is told, \"the cancer is not gone and will never be gone but we will treat it for as long as we can.\"2. If I was a cancer patient and read Pawelski\\'s posts, I couldn\\'t help but get depressed.Statements like these:-\"A tumor responds, shrinks a little, then quickly grows and spreads.\"-\"The cancer comes back with a vengeance.\"-\"...invade, metastasize, and generally wreak havoc\"-taxanes \"feverishly increase\" metastatic cells\"are brutally depressing.And, he repeatedly dishes it out. I\\'m not sure what his intention behind this is, but cancer patients who read this should know, as the blog hosts note at the top, that these are merely opinions from one man. (I have refuted many of the ideas in my other posts.)As for me, I need to move on from here, and I hope Mrs. Edwards, should he happen upon this blog, know that there are individuals out there who can, indeed, make a cancer patient really depressed.-3. <A href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/health/25couples.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\" rel=nofollow>http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/health/25couples.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin</A>4. Cancer is really bad thing to hear about or to get but the science has no limits so many cancers are treatable as Edward\\'s .Of course the science aims to overcome &amp; it will it but till now we can say that cancer management reached like Diabetes that one can live with it with good control.I hope that Elizabeth will be in good health in the near future.As medical student,cancer excited me as a field of study then it excited me when I saw many of my relatives suffering from it.That made me a blog to write about methods of cancer prevention &amp; how to overcome it.Ofcourse \"Prevention is much better than treatment\".Happy to read your comments on my blog:<A href=\"http://byetocancer.blogspot.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://byetocancer.blogspot.com/</A>5. hchcec, or whatever her new disguise is this month, has the habit of doing this kind of commenting to a number of people from a number of different web sites. They have no idea what reasons have led to her apparent negative, compulsive mindset. Indiscriminately spoken words of encouragement without substance is not an alternative to constructive advice.Patients should know what the demonstrated benefits are and the risks, because the treatments can be debilitating and even life-threatening. It takes time for doctors to sit down with patients and truly explain the benefits and the risks of treatment.In an ideal world, patients would consider the benefits and the risks of each treatment and make an informed decision with the guidance of a wise doctor. But, hurried doctors seldom spend much time discussing the benefits and the risks and few patients ever question whether treatment may do more harm than good.Anyone telling a cancer patient that chemotherapy and radiation treatment are the only hope of survival, strikes total fear by telling them they would die in a short time without it. Fear is the greastest tool to snare a fearful victim. 6. Those of us with advanced prostate cancer and supporters are getting ready to support approval of Provenge, a vaccine, at an FDA committee hearing this Thursday, March 29 in Maryland, near DC. (If interested, check the FDA website and come if you can.) While this drug too extended the average life for only a few months in the main clinical trial, the trial involved only men with very advanced cancer that would no longer respond to hormonal therapy, and it was not used in a combination, a tactic that often increases effectiveness. Even with the lukewarm survival advantage for the average patient, survival at the three year point was impressive for a minority of about 20%.As with my own triple hormonal blockade (plus maintenance therapy), results often do not look nearly as good for far advanced patients. But when used in less advanced patients, the results are sometimes impressive. Many of us think that will be the case with Provenge.While we are still looking for a breakthrough chemo drug or combination that will be highly effective for prostate cancer, Dr. Myers reminded us in a talk on March 17, that prior to 1971 survival after a diagnosis of testicular cancer was about six months, but that two new drugs were discovered in 1971 through 1973 that now produce routine cures for testicular cancer. Lance Armstrong is the poster boy for that breakthrough. That example certainly gives us reason to be optimistic.Jim7. Greg (and others),First let me say that I learn from reading your posts and look forward to more in the future. I am particularly impressed with your knowledge, insights and dedication.Your first post included these sentences, and I have some thoughts about them: \"There are so many new drugs coming down the pike that there is simply no way to evaluate them in prospective, randomized clinical trials.\" There certainly is a glut, but there is also a winnowing process, and as we both know drugs are making it into Phase III trials,coming up for FDA approval, and being approved. Granted, the glut cuts down the odds of any drug making it through to approval.You wrote: \"All of these drugs tend to be partially effective, and even then, in only a minority of cases, and often for only a short duration of time.\" Part of the reason is that the drugs are usually tested in Phase III in patients with very advanced cases who do not have long to live, thereby increasing the odds that there will be clear-cut survival statistics at the end of the trial. Some drugs do much better when used in patients who are less advanced, but the focus on survival statistics for approval trials makes it difficult to prove that. For instance, combined hormonal blockade for prostate cancer, at least as practiced five to ten years ago, did not do much to help very advanced patients, but has impressive effectiveness in less advanced cases like mine. Also, while averages usually are featured in trial reports, it is also clear that a minority of patients will do much better than the average. The trick is to see how to target those patients, and the medical community is slowly getting better at that. Another point is that combinations of approved drugs often work better than single drugs.You wrote: \"Tumor shrinkage should not be the criteria for approving cancer drugs. A patient responds to therapy when their tumor shrinks, but apparently this has nothing to do with survival. A tumor responds, shrinks a little, then quickly grows and spreads. The cancer comes back with a vengeance ....\" Your description fits some drugs, but there are others where tumors shrink and stay shrunk for extended periods or even disappear, not coming back with a vengeance. I\\'m not disagreeing with your statement as applied to some drugs, just with the implied generalization to all drugs.You continued: \"and the cancer patient is told, \"the cancer is not gone and will never be gone but we will treat it for as long as we can.\"\" Was all of this what you and your wife were told? I\\'m very sorry for what happened to both of you. For many of us, including Mrs. Edwards, whose remarks I just heard on 60 Minutes, there is a remote hope of a cure but also a nearer hope that personal circumstances or medical progress will be able to turn the cancer into a chronic, survivable disease, or at least quality years of life. I was originally given a prognosis by two respected doctors of five years around the start of 2000, and like Mrs. Edwards my prostate cancer is considered incurable by current technology. To me \"chronic\" sounds pretty good.Jim8. I\\'ll never be cured of my cancer I was diagnosed 2004 told 1yr , after surgury and on going chemoembolization for the rest of my life 10yrs possable. Mother of 5 youngest 5yrs old its never an easy day. God Bless All Who Survive!9. There seems to be a focus, by a few, on the idea that cancer treatment is unsuccessful, has not changed, and is entrenched in some large bureaucratic nightmare with NO ONE benefiting but oncologists.Let us not forget that when Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971, cancer was an automatic death sentence. There are people here who think that adding years to one\\'s life beyond diagnosis as opposed to living weeks or months in pain indicates a complete lack of success. Cancer is not a urinary tract infection. It changes the fundamental structure of your DNA. There are \"20 different regimens\" to treat breast cancer? Bravo. The patient and physician can make a choice. Options are open for changing. This is a bad thing? Giving one valuable time in the fight against a disease that results from mutations to genes that encode for proteins controlling cell division (wow), for me, is fantastic.As yet, there is no evidence at all that individualized chemotherapy testing does anything to change mortality numbers. The introduction of pharmacogenetic tests into routine healthcare requires both a demonstration of cost-effectiveness and the availability of appropriate accessible testing systems. The ONLY way to determine the benefit is through the scientific method, not anecdote.I encourage cancer patients and loved ones to do what is necessary to stay positive. Perhaps Mrs. Edwards will be a good role model for us as she articulates her hopes and fears and goes forward with the goals she has set for herself.You no longer have to go home and give up.As one survivor writes:\"Elizabeth Edwards is an example of a person living with, rather than dying from, cancer which is something I have lived with for 10 years. In those 10 years people have remarked, \"How do you keep going?\" Like Mrs. Edwards, I had to. Through treatment and recovery, I have been a hard-working TV producer, I have a social life, traveled domestically and abroad and have been an advocate for cancer issues. It hasnâ\\x80\\x99t always been easy to keep all the balls in the air, but what else could I do...sit around and be sick? If I did that, then cancer would be winning. So I live, and live the best life possible. Thank you, Mrs. Edwards, for showing people that we, survivors, can thrive.\"<A href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2007/03/23/couricandco/entry2600785.shtml\" rel=nofollow>http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2007/03/23/couricandco/entry2600785.shtml</A>The war on cancer continues. It\\'s not all bad news, as one might hear from some who comment.10. There are some four hundred drugs in the pipeline. There is simply no way to evaluate them in prospective, randomized clinical trials. Some trials are positive, some are negative, and it\\'s only after five years or so that have gone by and 5,000 patients or so, have been enrolled in the trials that anyone can draw conclusions. By then, what had been the \"standard\" treatment has now changed, because of all the new drugs which have been introduced. A \"standard\" therapy would not be for everyone. But having a lot of drugs available and making use of various tests to match treatment to the patient, would be a better option.There is seldom a \"standard\" therapy which has been proven to be superior to any other therapy. The number of possible treatment options supported by completed randomized clinical trials becomes increasingly vague for guiding physicians. Even the National Cancer Institute\\'s official cancer information website on chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer tells us that no data support the superiority of more than 20 different regimens. It is unclear whether single-agent chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy is preferable for first-line treatment. So it would appear that published reports of clinical trials provide precious little in the way of guidance.There have been patients who had long-term survival after high dose therapy, but there are a number whose tumors are responsive to chemotherapy who have had long-term remissions from standard dose chemotherapy, as well as a number who show no difference in survival when treated with standard-dose or high-dose chemotherapy. You may want to reserve aggressive therapy for those patients who would derive more benefit than harm, while identifying the most promising treatment regimens for everyone. In patients with tumors very resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy, the most promising treatments may be angiogenesis inhibitors, growth factor inhibitors, or more integrative medicine approaches.Charlie Rose did a special show some years back, inspired by the Fortune magazine article titled \"Why We\\'re Losing The War On Cancer.\" It was an interesting panel. The head of Memorial Sloan Kettering, and the head of the National Cancer Institute on the side of the cancer treatment establishment. Clifton Leaf, author of the Fortune article and Andy Grove, Chairman of Intel, both men are cancer survivors. Andy Grove spoke very passionately about the need to dismantle the established framework for fighting cancer, and rebuild it with a completely new structure. Emphasis on prevention, early detection and biomarkers are where resources need to be funneled, rather than palliative care directed at measurable goals such as shrinking the size of tumors in patients.It is time to set aside empiric \"one-size-fits-all\" treatment of cancer for \"individualized\" treatment based on testing the individual properties of each patient\\'s cancer.<A href=\"http://blog.aperio.com/articles/Fortune_Cancer.pdf\" rel=nofollow>http://blog.aperio.com/articles/Fortune_Cancer.pdf</A>11. My advice to those newly diagnosed with cancer or with a recurrence diagnosis:When you start to read or are told stories of other people with cancer and the words take the shape of a guaranteed unhappy ending...STOP...don\\'t read or listen any further. There is only one person with your cancer, equipped with your particular set of survival skills. Learn how to get the best treatment available right now and trust that research may come up with the absolute cure for your cancer in your lifetime. Most of all, do what the Edwards are doing and keep living your life. Leave a legacy for those you love that you lived your life with passion...And when you die they\\'ll know that your life was just long enough.12. Cancer treatment and survivability has indeed come a long way; maybe one day it will be curable. But in the meantime, to be able to class some cancers as \"manageable\" and view survival as a matter or long-term managed care is a big stride indeed. Hopefully people will get over the stigma of it as a death sentence. That notion does a great deal of harm.Regards,Richard Day Gore13. From researching a wide range of opinions on the topic something I see myself is this: The \"war on cancer\" in 1971 was promising a CURE within a few years. That\\'s why America was so willing to fund it. But that was a lot of hype too - marketing is marketing medical or not.We obviously don\\'t have a \"cure\" for most cancers and it\\'s been over 30 years. But that doesn\\'t mean - even back then - that everyone was \"sent home with a death sentence\" before chemo either. Cancer in itself does not mean you will die earlier than someone without cancer. But sometimes just knowing seems to stop people\\'s will to live. And if it\\'s advanced, well, then it\\'s kind of like having congestive heart failure isn\\'t it?One thing to consider is that our current \"treatment\" approach seems to be lacking in the \"will to live\" department. Beyond all the hype some of us wonder - Are we really going about this the right way?',\n",
       " 'Gardening is good for the soul. I\\'m sure of it. It did wonders for my grandma, who planted and flowered and blossomed for most of her life and long after her rounded back and arthritic fingers told her to stop. She just couldn\\'t help herself -- the fruits of the earth brought her such joy that the toll hard labor took on her body was somehow worth every trace of dirt that crumbled beneath her fingertips.In my own small way, I can\\'t resist either. I\\'m no lifelong gardener or anything. I\\'m more of a spur-of-the-moment kind of girl. And I haven\\'t a green thumb on either of my hands. My flowers always seem to die. Because no matter how much I love them at the beginning of the warm season, I end up neglecting them.I tell my husband every year, \"Please remind me not to buy flowers this year.\" It just seems silly to spend so much money only to toss my dead blooms after they wither and shrivel. So my husband reminds me. And I go right back out and buy more. Like I did today.I spent about an hour with my little boys shoveling dirt and arranging red and orange and yellow and white flowers in all sorts of pots. It was a priceless hour -- although really it cost me about 60 bucks. It was refreshing and rejuvenating and in a way, healing. I know the effects of today\\'s flower therapy will fade, just as the flowers themselves will fail to thrive. But I also know I will do it all again next year. Because it\\'s good for my soul. And I just can\\'t resist. Comments: ',\n",
       " \"Elizabeth Edwards' breast cancer recurrence has the disease once again dominating newspapers, magazines, television programs, and conversations. Just two days ago, I heard a run-down of facts about breast cancer. They were shared to raise awareness, and while I was already aware of most of them, it's still quite sobering to hear some of the statistics that surround a disease that lands in the laps of more than 200,000 American women every year.Think about these -- three powerful truths that happen to stick in my mind at this very moment:The highest risk of breast cancer belongs to those older than 60.Nearly 85 percent of women diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history of the disease.And tragically, every three minutes, a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer.

       " 'The experts at Canyon Ranch resort and spa know what they\\'re talking about when it comes to health and happiness. They make a living off their expertise, in fact. But they\\'re not stingy when it comes to sharing their know-how, and on the Canyon Ranch website, they offer us all a chance to better our lives.I promised in an earlier post to share more of what the Canyon Ranchers have to say -- so here are seven more healthy habits you just might want to embrace.To Carb or Not to CarbCanyon Ranch has watched \"fad\" diets come and go, never falling for their quick, easy-fix mentality and consistently advocating for balance, moderation and basic good nutrition. In recent years, some diets have forsaken whole grains for foods rich in protein and essentially free of carbohydrates. Whole grains, which are carbs, have always been a vital part of good nutrition. And while removing high-carbohydrate foods from your diet may initially help you lose weight faster, over time their absence can negatively influence your health.Making Time for TimePeople take classes to learn time management, they rely on the latest technologies to make the most of it and budget time as carefully as their money. Still, when it comes to health care, you may find yourself in a time crunch. Fortunately, Carl Pratt, managing director of the Canyon Ranch in Lenox, offers a timely solution: The 90-Minute Program. \"It really only takes 90 minutes a week to stay focused on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. If you aren\\'t willing to dedicate 90 minutes, you aren\\'t willing to take care of yourself, and you need to accept that fact,\" says Carl. Carl breaks down the 90 minutes per week as follows:   15 minutes of planning for \"mindful eating\"   45 minutes of exercise (15 minutes, three days a week)   30 minutes of relaxation (five minutes, six days a   week)Commuting BlissWhen you change your mindset and treat commutes as a transition time for relaxation or education by listening to music or books on tape, your daily drive becomes a worthwhile experience. \"We all see commutes as inconvenient, and we need to think of them as something valuable. Remember, the ultimate removal of commute time is not what people want. Otherwise, we would go directly from birth to death and skip everything in between. If you can\\'t enjoy the commute -- and indeed, some are more difficult than others -- you are simply losing part of your life,\" says Robert Rhode, Ph.D., clinical psychologist at Canyon Ranch in Tucson.Family Bonds Tied to Well-BeingEven painful family connections can be a significant part of personal growth. Learn to feel reverence toward yourself even as you feel pain. This connects you with your humanity and your ability to give and receive love. How to get comfortable with painful memories? Relax your body and allow yourself to feel emotions -- anger, pain, sadness -- while maintaining a positive attitude toward you.An Attitude of GratitudeBeing thankful each day for the good things in your life and the ability to appreciate what you have rather than what you do not have is an important aspect of emotional health and well-being.Think BigOne key to spiritual well-being is to get outside yourself with activities such as volunteering or contributing to worthy causes.\"Get involved with others and become committed to something greater than yourself. You start worrying about the greater good and you feel better about yourself,\" says Evan Kligman, M.D., at Canyon Ranch in Tucson.Not a Morning Person? It\\'s OKGiving yourself a workout boost first thing is great for some, but an early morning workout may not be for everyone. Phil Eichling, M.D., sleep expert at Canyon Ranch in Tucson, encourages people with sleep problems to put off their workout for later. He says to enhance sleep, the best time to exercise is usually late afternoon. And people who have cardiovascular issues or certain other health concerns may also want to ease into the day before they strap on their running shoes or cross trainers. Comments: 1.

       " 'White House press secretary and colon cancer survivor Tony Snow asks the public to refrain from jumping to conclusions regarding the surgery he will have on Monday to remove a growth from his lower abdomen.Blood tests and a CAT scan of the growth show no presence of cancer, he reports. But still, he and doctors are proceeding cautiously due to his history.Snow, a former Fox News radio and television talk show host, was diagnosed with cancer two years ago, when he was a commentator at Fox. Two months after surgery, he returned to the air and then became White House press secretary in April 2006.Snow\\'s plan is to be back behind the podium a few weeks after surgery, when he has a better idea of what it is he\\'s dealing with. Comments: 1. I recently read an article where Mr. Snow shared that knowing you have cancer brings fear. The opposite of fear is \"faith\". When my mother was ill,everyone that came to visit or called us would ask, \"what can I do for you?\" My response would be \"pray\". I would tell this to everyone I knew or didn\\'t know -to send up a prayer for my mother, and before you knew it- what seemed \"bleak\" became \"hope\" and the \"hope\" turned into a \"miracle\". We may not always agree on what makes the world turn, but every now and then, we can all use a little \"hope\",\"faith\", and \"prayer\". Mr. Snow I have sent one up for you. 2. We\\'re a family of intelligent, educated, and oftentimes ruthless liberals. However, upon learning about Mr. Tony Snow\\'s recurrence of cancer - my heart skipped a beat and I immediately said a prayer for him. When I told my cousin, she said \"he\\'s no longer a republican - he\\'s a human being and we care.\" As we should. Fight hard, Mr. Snow; fight hard! With love and prayer - friends in Ohio3. Tony, You will remain in our prayers until you beat this medical crisis. Keeping a positive attitude and faith in God will see you through. You can do it.Keith &amp; Della FultonLempster, NH 036054. Tony, Our thoughts and prayers are with you. You are not only the best press secretary that we have ever had, but equally a very nice man. We wish you and your family well. Keep that positive attitude and know that we are praying for you every day.Lee and Mary NelsonMesquite, NV 5. Mr. Snow:You make White House press conferences so much more interesting and insightful. You are sorely missed.I, too, am a cancer survivor and I join in with the many others who are praying for your health and good spirits. Keep fighting!! You have more to do and we need you.God bless and keep you safe in His arms while you go through all that is to come. You are in the thoughts and prayers of millions of us.6. Dear Tony,About 15 years ago you hosted the Rush Limbaugh show on radio. My husband is a \"Tony Snow fan\" and was bound and determined to talk to you during that week you were on. He did get through and came home boasting how he had talked with you. (I think it was over term limits) He watched you religiously on Fox every Sunday morning. This to say there are many people who will miss you so fight this fight with all you have!! Know there are people who you don\\'t know praying for you and your family. God speed!Deborah CookLittle Rock, AR.7. Dear Tony,We were saddened to learn this morning of the news that you\\'ve been diagnosed with liver cancer. We know you are a positive person. We send you good wishes and prayers, and hope to see you soon back at the White House.Yours truly,Robert and Barbara Goss8. Hang in there Tony! You are a respectful and dedicated AMERICAN. You will beat this bump in the road and my wife and I will pray for your speedy recovery! Jerry Johnson U.S.N.(ret) Ward Ar. 9. Tony and Family, Prayers are going out for you and your family. The Lord is walking right with you through all this. You are an awesome gentleman and your smiling face on Fox and now the White House Press Room is a beautiful change. Your positive outlook is amazing. Just want to and your family to know that through this battle you have God and so many people praying for you.Richard and Bonnie DormanPownal,VT10. Mr. Snow:You are a great spokesman for good vs evil, right vs wrong and reality over insanity. This country is going to need people like you if we are to survive the future and we are all sailing along with you and counting on you to continue the fight. Chin up and hang tough - you are much loved and admired.Stan B 11. Mr Snow please look into RFA (radio frequency ablation) for your current condition. There is a physician at Rhode Island Hospital Providence, RI who has been performing these procedures with great success. Check the net his name is Damion Dupys. There are no radical surgical procedures involved. Only the insertion of a needle that in effect microwaves the cancer from the affected site.I wish you and your family well.JWG12. I am sorry to here you have this disease. But don\\'t despair because there are treatments and not just the destructive chemo and radiation which brougth my mother-in-laws demise that much quicker. The Gerson Institute in San Diego, Ca., offers an all natural, real cure. Have a family member google it and read up on it. It nearly was the treatment for the USA and narrowly lost in Congress. I pray you investigate and get well.May God bless and protect you in this time of need!13. You\\'ve been an encouragement Tony, Now we ask for huge encouragement for you, health and vitality restored.Bless you! Mikki and Dave Webster14. Tony Snow I have been watching you on Fox since you started and now you are the best Press Secretary ever. You are admired by so many and the power of prayer and the is great and you will be getting the best possible doctors and care so keep strong and know that you are loves and admired by so many. You and your family are in my thought and prayers. from a huge fan. Connie F. Stuart, Fl.15.

A word to Juliann Brumbaugh who commented earlier--if more people felt like you, it would be a better world. Illness and suffering know no party affiliation, nor should our love for others.Regards,Richard Day Gore17. Dear Tony, We are so sorry to hear about the recurrence of your cancer. It\\'s a setback, but there are so many new drugs and treatment for your type of cancer, that you should be encouraged as you go forward. We will pray for your recovery and for your family\\'s welfare during this trying time.You are a fine gentleman and you deserve the very best. Terry and John Karcich18.

       " \"Not everyone buys into the power of pink when it comes to breast cancer. Pink ribbons, pink teddy bears, pink hats, shirts, scarves, socks, purses, jewelry, magnets, and even cooking appliances have monopolized the breast cancer market. And some people just plain refuse to associate the disease with anything remotely sweet, soft, and soothing.Think about this: Annette`s Angels, founded in 2006 by the children of Annette Roberta, love and applaud the effectiveness of the flood of pink used to raise awareness about a disease that took Roberta after a 15-year battle. But they refuse to embrace any color but black as they proceed to kick breast cancer in the butt. Black reflects their anger at breast cancer. And their power to fight it.Annette's Angels are committed to fighting this terrible disease, and they invite us all to shop at their online store, where some items -- there's just no way around it really -- are pink.

       " \"I'm never quite sure about what foods I should eat and what foods I should not eat. Sometimes I hear that fish is healthy and recommended and then I hear that I should not eat fish at all due to concerns such as mercury levels. It seems that opinion on certain foods -- like fish and carbohydrates and dairy items -- sways and changes, which leaves me uncertain about how I might approach my diet in the best possible way. But opinion on red meat seems to be getting more and more consistent -- as more and more studies indicate that red meat is associated with a variety of health problems. And now red meat appears to raise the risk of developing pancreatic cancer, according to a Swedish report in the International Journal of Cancer. More than 61,000 women were studied for possible effects of meat, fish, poultry, and egg consumption. After 17 years, 172 of these women were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and researches say it's because of the red meat. I suppose this could have been a coincidence -- and these women were destined for their diagnoses regardless of diet. But researchers conclude that long-term consumption of red meat is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer -- one of the most deadly cancers that is seldom detected at an early, curable stage.The good news from this study -- there does not seem to be a connection between pancreatic cancer and the consumption of fish and eggs. And the consumption of poultry may actually cut the risk of pancreatic cancer. Comments: \",\n",

But when Gu used concentrations of one percent -- about one to two drinks per day in humans -- to study blood vessel growth, he detected stimulated tumor growth in both chick embryos and mice. Thus, his cancer discovery was born.Gu has further concluded that melanoma cancers in mice grew significantly faster and larger in the mice who consumed the equivalent of one or two alcoholic drinks a day than the mice receiving no alcohol.Gu's findings, now confirmed by other scientists, are evidence of what many have long suspected -- alcohol, even in moderation, increases cancer risk.

       " 'Ever since revealing her breast cancer had recurred, there has been speculation about a spread from Elizabeth Edwards\\' rib -- the initial metastasis -- to other spots in her body.Last night, on the CBS news program 60 Minutes, Edwards told Katie Couric that a hot spot has been detected in her right hip. But doctors believe it is too small to pose a new health risk, she reports.\"There are a couple of hot spots, on the bone scan, in my right hip, for example,\" she said. \"And one of the questions is whether or not to do radiation to reduce the size of that -- of the cancer in that location -- and for fear that it might weaken my bone and that I might break my hip. But their consensus was that it was too small an area for that to be a risk.\"In addition to discussion about the cancer itself, Edwards and her husband John defended their decision to stick with the presidential race. Edwards said she just cannot deny her husband the chance to be president.\"That would be my legacy, wouldn\\'t it, Katie?\" Edwards said to Couric. \"That I\\'d taken out this fine man from -- from the possibility of -- of giving a great service. I mean, I don\\'t want that to be my legacy.\" Comments: \"That would be my legacy, wouldn\\'t it, Katie?\" Edwards said to Couric. \"That I\\'d taken out this fine man from -- from the possibility of -- of giving a great service.

I have been battling a reocurrance of breast cancer, origionally diagnosed stage one 16 years ago, for the last 3 years. Like Mrs. Edwards, the reocurrance is in my bones, only more widespread. I have hot spots in my spine, mediastynime, ribs, hip, knee, and femur. I have had radiation and chemo. to keep the disease stable. So far the disease has not gone to any major organs. I had origionally thought I would only live for around 6 months. I am now into my fourth year, having celebrated my 48th through my 51st birthdays. We don\\'t know how long we have to live. All of us are terminal. Two other first ladies battled breast cancer while their husbands were in office. I believe that if we don\\'t follow our dreams and take a chance we will never have a life that amounts to more then just an existance. I have been trying to raise 3 teenage girls through all of this and believe it or not dealing with breast cancer has been an easier task.4. As Elizabeth Edwards\\' cancer spreads , is it appropriate for John Edwards to continue his political campaign?5. Giacomo, we see yoo. Could you please stop trying to direct people to your blog?In answer to the question, I\\'m already broiling that there is (of course) controvery over this. How an individual or family chooses to deal with something as devastating as a potentially fatal cancer is a completely personal decision. No one, no one is qualified to throw a judgment on it. Regards,Richard Day Gore6. The return of cancer as bone metastisis is not always a death sentence. I had a reoccurence in the spring of 2002 with mets in the rib and T10 vertabrae. These were treated successfully with radiation and since then six more bone tumors (four being in the boney pelvis,two in the ribs)have been treated with favorable results. At least four lymph nodes have been radiated as well. So yes, Elizabeth, march on, I\\'m living proof that miracles can happen and prayers can make a difference.Best regards,Mark Sheely7. My wife also has metastatic breast cancer. I could go into all of her specifics here, but the vast majority of people looking at this blog are, I\\'m sure, already familiar with the trials and tribulations that go along with this dreaded disease. Therefore, I prefer to shed light on something not mentioned when speaking of the Edwards\\' and Snows\\' cases. As senior government employees, they both retain their health care insurance, whether they choose to stay at work, or choose to leave their careers. As a Teamster, I have some of the best health coverage available, yet, if I choose to leave my job, to stay home and take care of my wife, my coverage (along with my wife\\'s coverage) lapses within 2 months time. This is a best case scenario for working people. The vast majority of working class have little or no health coverage. The luxury that we afford our elected officials, to retain health coverage while caring for a loved one, should also be available to their constituents. The news people reporting on the Edward\\'s situation never bat an eye when speaking about Mr. Edwards choice to continue to seek office. What isn\\'t said, but is implied, is that if he and his wife chose to stay home and deal with Elizabeth\\'s cancer treatment, they wouldn\\'t be faced with a discontinuation of health coverage. We live in the greatest country in the world, and yet seldom take care of our own. Perhaps Mr. Edwards will see things a little differently when addressing health care on a national level. Its very sad what he and his wife will face in the future. I know first hand, yet I repeatedly hear the union bashing and ridicule from our elected officials when health care is addressed. Maybe they\\'d see things from a different perspective if they were forced to live by the same rules as those who elect them to office. 8. I hear you Mike! In the USA your right to health only extends as far as your ability to pay for it. As someone who barely survived cancer without insurance, I think it\\'s a shameful situation.Regards,Richard Day Gore9. Is it possible to e-mail Elizabeth Edwards.

       " 'I\\'m never quite sure what to do about vitamin supplements. Should I take them? Or should I leave them? Sometimes I think supplements could surely help me with whatever I\\'m lacking in my diet. Other times I don\\'t want to mess with what might be working just fine in my body. Now if a doctor tells me my iron is low, I\\'ll take a supplement to boost my levels. But if there is nothing apparently off kilter in my system, I tend to just leave things alone. I\\'m glad at the moment for my current plan. Because nutritionists now suspect that high doses of vitamins and minerals -- believed by some to prevent cancer -- might actually be harmful.Think about this:The American Medical Association journal JAMA recently reported that high doses of antioxidant supplements can be harmful. Vitamin advocates challenged the analysis, saying it excluded large studies from China and Italy showing antioxidant supplements lowered mortality risk.Consumers still should read labels carefully. \"Some of the things called daily vitamins can be higher than what we think is desirable,\" says one researcher who urges consumers to look for something about 100 percent of the daily value. That\\'s really all people need, she declares. But a healthy diet is still most important and can prevent the need for supplements altogether. Yet for those who are sick, don\\'t have access to nutritious food or for some other reason cannot eat well, the 100-percent rule is a good guide. Comments: 1. I love the University of Pittsburgh\\'s Alternative Medicine Clinic. When I went there, the M.D. told me to only use Twin Labs brand of vitamins...no polyglocol or other things in them. Only buy a good brand of vitamin and suppliments and you can go to the USA government\\'s Alternative Medicine Website to get information also. So many vitamins have bad additives in them. Only buy USA made vitamins and suppliments. READ THE LABELS. Foreign glycerin could even have mad cow disease in them. Herbs work. But learn about them and get natural ones, not imported stuff. Grow them in your yard.....LEARN about healing herbs. GROW them yourself! Dandelions are good! Chemlawn kills! You can eat dandilions for your health.

A few days ago Elizabeth Edwards, wife of presidential candidate John Edwards, shared that her own breast cancer, originally diagnosed in 2004, has relocated to her bones. United States Press secretary Tony Snow is a colon cancer survivor. Presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani is a prostate cancer survivor. Candidate John McCain has had three bouts with melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Bob Dole, now 83, was a cancer survivor at age 73 when he ran for the White House as the 1996 Republican presidential nominee against President Clinton. And the 2004 Democratic nominee, John Kerry, had prostate cancer surgery in 2003.If I did more research, I bet I'd turn up a whole slew of other politicians who have received a direct hit from cancer. But that's not necessary. I think what I'm trying to demonstrate is already clear.Take any sector of society and cancer will somehow be woven into the lives of those who define the population. Athletes and cancer. Celebrities and cancer. Musicians and cancer. Kids and cancer. Young moms and cancer. Men and cancer. Politicians and cancer. This brings me to my next point -- cancer is widespread, so widespread it surfaces over and over again within any given group of people. This makes me sad. But this infiltration of the disease also means none of us is alone. And as a woman with cancer; a young mom with cancer; a wife, a daughter, a sister with cancer; and a writer with cancer, this makes me feel comforted, supported, and utterly strong. Comments: \",\n",

       " 'More than 200,000 American women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year. And about six percent of all invasive breast cancer cases involve a condition called inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), the most aggressive and often undiagnosed form of the disease.IBC does not present itself in the form of a lump or mass and is typically not detected by self-examination, mammogram, or ultrasound.IBC is a misunderstood disease. But if women learn to recognize some of the symptoms, there is a better chance for better diagnosis, treatment, and survival.Think about this, a list of early symptoms of IBC:â\\x80¢ One breast rapidly becomes larger than the otherâ\\x80¢ Breast has a rash, redness, or blotchinessâ\\x80¢ Breast and/or nipple persistently itchesâ\\x80¢ Breast tissue thickens or feels lumpyâ\\x80¢ Breast becomes sore with sharp painsâ\\x80¢ Breast is warm to the touch or feverishâ\\x80¢ Lymph nodes under the arm or above the collarbone become swollenâ\\x80¢ Breast dimples and may look like the skin of an orangeâ\\x80¢ Nipple retracts or flattensâ\\x80¢ Color of the areola (the dark skin around the nipple) changes Contact your doctor immediately if you detect any of these symptoms.

Thank you for telling women about Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) - the breast cancer usually with NO lump and that often doesn\\'t show on a mammogram! I was diagnosed with IBC in 3/05 and I was mad that I had never known there was a breast cancer that wouldn\\'t be found by doing BSE\\'s and having mammos. When I was diagnosed, I had a mammogram three days before and nothing showed and was misdiagnosed by a breast center at a major hospital! I had IBC in both breasts! IBC is always Stage 3 or 4 and is found at an average median age of 52 - 10 years younger than \"garden variety\" breast cancer. Many of our IBC Sisters have become Pathfinders in their 20\\'s, 30\\'s and 40\\'s. Thank you and PLEASE continue to help spread the word about IBC; that you CAN have breast cancer with no lump.',\n",
       " \"Time to test your smarts -- about sleep, sun, food, and alcohol. Just read the following questions, pick an option and then scroll down to determine if you really know what's best for your health.   Is it healthier to sleep an extra hour or force yourself out of bed in the   morning to exercise?   Is it healthier to spend 15 minutes in the sun without sunscreen or two   hours in the sun wearing SPF 30?   Is it better to have a second glass of wine at dinner or a sinful dessert?   Is it healthier to sleep an extra hour or force yourself out of bed in the morning to exercise?It's healthier to get out of bed and exercise. Research shows a full eight hours of sleep -- often touted as the necessary amount of slumber -- is not really necessary for optimum health. In fact, those sleeping about seven hours per night enjoy a lower mortality rate than those sleeping eight hours or more.But exercise is necessary for optimum health. So roll yourself out of bed early, head outdoors for some fresh air and sunlight and in time, you will reset your body clock.If you are sleep deprived, however, due to a new baby, an illness, or all-nighters, by all means -- sleep. Don't sacrifice sleep for exercise if you are already lacking in this department.Is it healthier to spend 15 minutes in the sun without sunscreen or two hours in the sun wearing SPF 30?Fifteen minutes of pure sun provides a necessary dose of vitamin D, but it also takes its toll. It's better to ingest vitamin D, says one expert, by drinking juice fortified with calcium or taking a calcium supplement or multivitamin.So heading into the sun for two hours -- with SPF 30 -- is the smarter choice. But stay tuned for more on the possible negative effects of sunscreen.Is it better to have a second glass of wine at dinner or a sinful dessert?Take dessert -- just don't overdo it -- over that glass of wine. Because drinking more than one alcoholic beverage per day is known to increase risk of cancer and other health problems.Quiz questions and answers were found in the August 2005 issue of Real Simple magazine.

       " \"When I told my husband that the use of cannabis is being linked to a five percent increase in lung cancer risk -- that's 15 new cases each year in New Zealand where a study was just conducted -- he seemed to think this risk is comparable to his dying from a grasshopper landing in his eye.A scientist John is not, but his thoughts on the matter seem to parallel international thinking on the drug which goes something like this: the risk marijuana use has on cancer incidence is so very low it's hardly worthy of much worry.A California study of more than 1600 people last year found no link between cancer and smoking the drug, despite researchers' prediction they would find some kind of connection.New Zealand researchers have found a connection, though, and however small it may seem, they say it's significant.They found the risk of developing lung cancer increased by about eight percent each year for people whose cumulative exposure equated to smoking one joint per day -- about the same as the increase for someone who smokes one pack of cigarettes per day. They also found the younger someone starting smoking cannabis, the greater the risk and that contributing risk factors include smokers' deeper inhalation and the tendency to hold smoke in their lungs.Cannabis, the most commonly used recreational drug in the world with 161 million users, has been thought to have a protective effect against cancer due to its chemical THC, which appears to kill aging cells and keep them from becoming cancerous. This study may prove otherwise. Comments: 1. I believe the California study you refer to was from UCLA. And if I remember correctly, the study not only found no link between pot smoking and cancer, it actually found a protective effect against lung cancer.

       " \"I get mammograms every six months. I get ultrasounds every six months. I get a breast MRI every year. That's my typical screening routine, intended to keep breast cancer from invading my life for a second time. This combination of testing -- primarily the MRI part -- has not been typical for all at-risk women. It's just the plan my doctors have determined is the best insurance policy for me. But as of yesterday, the American Cancer Society began recommending regular use of MRI scans, rather than conventional mammograms, for women facing a breast cancer risk of 15 percent or more.Family history places one to two percent of women at a 20 percent higher risk of developing the disease than women without such a history. Women carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA 2 gene mutation face a lifetime risk of up to 65 percent. And women with a personal history of the disease are at risk of a repeat diagnosis. These are the women MRI screening can help.Recent studies show MRI to be much more sensitive than mammograms. And in an investigation of 969 women diagnosed with breast cancer in one breast, MRI found 30 additional tumors in the opposite breast previously missed by mammograms and physical exams.Not typically used for routine screenings due to cost and a few false alarms -- sometimes the scans detect suspicious areas that once surgically tested turn out to be benign -- MRI is still the best tool for detecting more cancerous tumors earlier.There is no proof yet that the cancers detected by MRI will translate into longer lives for patients. Life-extending benefits will become clear only after women are followed for a longer period of time. Comments: \",\n",

Prose literacy measures the skills needed to understand texts such as new stories, brochures, and instruction manuals. People with basic skills can perform simple, everyday literacy activities. Those with below-basic skills are proficient in only the most simple and concrete literacy.How is it that these individuals, when they are diagnosed with a disease such as cancer, are able to understand the medical jargon thrown their way, the literature that piles up in front them, the complicated process we call the medical system?They aren\\'t. And this leads to increased chances that people will be hurt, even killed, in the course of their medical treatment.There are many barriers that lead to miscommunication -- cultural differences, language problems, and overall poor literacy skills -- and experts in this area are recommending some changes. They urge more education and training for health care professionals who may not ever imagine someone might not understand their words. They suggest health teams use medical interpreters. And they seek to embrace a culture of easy-to-understand communication in all aspects of medical care.Toni Cordell, a nationally-known health literacy advocate, says humiliation and shame washed over her three decades ago when her gynecologist told her she needed a simple repair and she woke from surgery to learn she\\'d had a hysterectomy.

But a version of pizza as we know it may fend off heart disease, obesity, and cancer.The secret is in the crust -- the cooking of the crust, that is.Think about this:It seems baking pizza faster and at higher temperatures can release disease-fighting antioxidants. And it's this one small change to pizza preparation that has scientists at the University of Maryland claiming there is such a thing as a healthy pizza.Scientists baked pizza at 500 degrees for six minutes and were able to increase antioxidant levels 100 percent. They used whole wheat dough, already high in antioxidants, and let it rise overnight before using their hotter, quicker cooking approach.One researcher says this study is more a lab curiosity than anything else and might not really lead to a healthier pizza -- because it's unlikely pizza joints will change cooking methods to turn out healthier products.If you are tempted to try this technique, be aware that the toxin acrylamide can be released if the pizza is baked too long.

It's even been linked to a decreased risk of inflammatory and cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women.Why? According to an article in the March 2007 issue of Ladies Home Journal, it's because coffee contains large amounts of flavonoids and antioxidants -- and these combat a whole bunch of illnesses.Now drinking too much coffee can have adverse side effects, like restlessness, anxiety, and headaches, but limiting yourself to one to four brewed cups per day seems to be a safe practice. Although for those with high blood pressure, consuming between two to four cups per day maybe a bit risky because coffee causes blood pressure to rise immediately after consumption. And all coffee drinkers should fight the urge to add sugar, flavored syrup, and whole milk to to their beverages.A daily cup of tea seems to be healthy too. Researchers are investigating its use in the prevention of cancer, and we already know both black and green tea have significant quantities of disease-fighting flavonoids -- although not as much as coffee.

This is exactly why I like it. But there's an underlying story not written into the script that has compelled me to watch -- and truly enjoy -- this show.Barry Watson, best known for his role as Matt Camden on the long-running WB series 7th Heaven, is surviving cancer. Diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma in May 2002, he received treatment and reported in April 2003 that he was in remission. And he's been working hard ever since.Watson is not only an actor.

I'm always doing something -- writing, emptying the dishwasher, packing a school lunch, reorganizing cabinets and closets and drawers. There's always something to fiddle with, something to keep my body from crashing into a deep sleep.My little boys have been playing with Lego all afternoon. For hours they have been content and happy and full of imagination. They've built flying boats and castles and pirate contraptions. My wish: to just sit and watch them, to absorb their words, their sound effects, their interactions. I tried to just sit and watch, tried to hone my quiet observation skills. And then I fell sleep.It's a dozing-off kind of sleep that creeps up on me and for brief moments, I am lost to the world, sometimes even dreaming for short periods of time. So I find I am more alert and productive in the study of my children when my mind is busy with some sort of task. It's not my ideal scenario.

There's probably a day that does not go by that it's not on your mind in some way. You have your children, your home, writing for the blog, research, daily chores, shopping, need I go on. I think the times that you just sit and watch your boys is the time your body is saying, it's time to rest for awhile. Watching the boys brings peaceful thoughts, quiet thoughts, feeling safe, so you just drift off into your own little world.Your multitasking is probably due to your schedule. Without a doubt you are a very busy woman. Speaking for myself, sometimes when I am multitasking to the extreme it's to keep my mind preoccupied, as not to think about my physical health, or allowing my thoughts go to a negative place. But, there comes that time when I simply have to rest, as my body and mind are telling me so, and so I sleep.I think you should not feel guilty for taking a little time just for you, even if it is just taking a nap. Somehow, I have a feeling you do spend quality time with your boys.You need and deserve breaks, so take your naps, enjoy your quiet time.

       " \"I think obesity will always carry with it a risk for health problems. And according to a new study released on Monday, men with prostate cancer who are overweight have a higher risk of tumor recurrence after radiation treatment than thinner men do. Specifically, moderately and severely overweight men had a 70 percent higher risk of recurrence than men who were not overweight -- as indicated by rising levels of PSA, a blood protein that can signal prostate cancer. It is not clear how exactly obesity affects the success of radiation treatment -- perhaps it's the fat tissue that secretes certain hormones that helps the cancer progress at a later time. Regardless, the study suggests that men who are overweight do not fare as well as those who are at an average weight -- and this gives men a definite reason to trim down.Obesity in this study was characterized by body mass index -- BMI -- a statistic that takes into account height and weight. A man five feet, 10 inches tall would be considered normal weight at or below 184 pounds. He would be overweight at 185 to 209 pounds, mildly obese at 210 to 244 pounds, and moderately to severely obese at above 244 pounds. Moderately to severely obese men had almost twice the risk of developing elevated PSA levels, according to an epidemiologist who led research in the study -- which will be published in the August 1 issue of the scientific journal Cancer.

It seems through the passing yrs, Dr-patient relationships have changed, where people are suffering as a result of this so-called change.Dr\\'s are becoming less involved with their patients. I realize some are being over loaded with patients, which in turn does not allow them very much time per patient, then it\\'s the patient that suffers. Usually, passed on to a specialist, then someone else, and the ball just keeps rolling.I have been to clinics with great Dr\\'s, it only took 2 to 4 hrs to get into the actual office to see the Dr, by that time I was in a full asthma attack, so, on to the hospital for a 3 day stay. And then I\\'ve been to Dr\\'s who really just did not give a damn. And finally, you manage to find a good physician but; he or she only listens part time. I think that is another issue and problem we patients or clients suffer from. These so called professionals listen or hear what they want to hear. At least this has been my experience. Getting involved with my diagnosis has not been a problem, getting the Dr to listen to all symptoms is the problem. How can a Dr give a proper diagnosis without knowing what all of the symptoms are? Then if you develope new symtoms, God help you.With so many different diseases out there, a lot of the symtoms can be very much the same, but that does not mean the treatment is the same.Some professionals find it easier to just pass the buck, maybe it eases their conscious, I\\'m not really sure. I have been places where people are pushed through exams or consultations like cattle at an auction yard. And then, you have those certain, so called professionals, that might as well accuse you of lying or exaggerating your symtoms. To just up and change Dr\\'s is not as easy as it might sound, as some of you probably know. To even have med. insurance now day\\'s is a luxury, that is if your Dr\\'s accept it.I believe there are good, caring, sincere people in the medical field, we just have to find them. And by all means if you feel you are being set aside, not being cared for properly, physically or mentally, get a referral to another Dr, your life and well being may depend on it.Sorry for writing so much, this subject concerns me very much. And to all of those without any medical insurance hang on, some things have to change sooner or later!Blessings to all,Take care, Jason4. I think the first poster linked to an article about a different book, How Doctors Think by Jerome Groopman. I actually just finished reading that one and it also talks about avoiding misdiagnosis and getting proper patient care in today\\'s healthcare industry. Anyway, it\\'s another good resource. I really enjoyed it.',\n",
       " \"Cancer is a complicated disease often described by those who know it well in confusing medical, technical, and scientific terms. There's a way to understand it in simple terms, though. And a recent CBS news story features a great run-down on the disease, its causes, how it grows, and more.Think about this:   Cancer refers to any one of a large number of diseases characterized   by the uncontrollable growth of abnormal cells. These cells have the ability   to infiltrate and destroy normal tissue and can spread -- metastasize --   throughout the body.   Cancer is caused by damage in the DNA. DNA is like a set of   instructions for cells and tells cells how to grow and divide. Normal cells   can develop mutations in their DNA but can repair most of them. If they cannot   make a repair, the cells often die. But certain mutated cells don't repair and   don't die. They instead grow and become cancerous.   Normal, healthy cells grow in an orderly, well-controlled way. They   live for a set period of time and then die on schedule. Dead cells are   replaced by new normal cells. Cancer cells, in contrast, grow in an   uncontrolled manner. They don't die. They accumulate. One malignant cell   becomes two, two become four, four become eight, and so on, until a mass of   cells -- a tumor -- is created. Tumors remain small until they're able to   attract their own blood supply, which allows them to obtain the oxygen and   nutrients they need to grow larger.   Not all cancers form tumors. Leukemia, for example, is a cancer of the   blood, bone marrow, lymphatic system, and spleen.  Cancer can take decades to develop. By the time a cancerous mass is   detected, it's likely that 100 million to one billion cancer cells are   present, and the original cancer may have been dividing for five years or   more.   Lung cancer is the top cancer killer among men and women and will kill   160,390 people in 2007.  Comments: \",\n",
       " 'Seven sweet, simple words were hurled at me last night by my oldest child, Joey -- the boy who makes me as crazy as he does happy.Joey, six, was all snuggled in bed, cozy with his soft blankets, squishy pillows, and three favorite stuffed puppies. I gave him my usual speech -- Sweet dreams. I love you. Now don\\'t get out of bed -- and then made my usual trek to another room for some me-time. My trip was stopped short, though, because a strong urge inspired me to reverse my steps and return to Joey.\"What are you doing, mommy?\" Joey asked as I walked back into the room.\"I thought I\\'d come rest with you for a little bit,\" I told him. \"Is that OK?\" I asked, knowing full well any excuse to avoid sleep is just fine with himJoey sat straight up, pure joy coloring his tired face. I took this to mean he welcomed my return. And so I crawled into bed and hugged Joey tight. And that\\'s when he spoke the seven words that caused tears to pour from my eyes -- the kind of tears that spill out when the human body can no longer harness its emotion.The words:\"Mommy, I love you so, so much.\"Ever since Joey blessed me with these words, I can\\'t seem to get one thought out of my head.The thought:God, I hope I survive cancer long enough to hold this boy in my arms until he is all grown up, until he is wrapping his arms around his own loving child.I really hope this is not too much to ask. Comments: 1. Well Jacki, it sounds as if you managed some exceptional quality time with little Joey. I am happy for the both of you. Just take each day as it comes to you.

       " 'There\\'s this guy. His name is Matthew Zachary. He\\'s a cancer survivor, a motivational speaker, a concert pianist, and the founder of a resource portal for young adults surviving cancer.Steps for Living, Inc. -- also known as I\\'m too young for this -- was created by Zachary because he wants us all to know there are awesome cancer support services out there for adolescents and young adults. He means really awesome opportunities -- like spa retreats, online forums and blogs, social networking, camping excursions, fertility education, peer counseling, financial scholarships, and more.You may be too young for cancer, but you are not alone, says Zachary whose mantra is Get Busy Living. And this is exactly what he is doing, despite challenges and setbacks in his own cancer recovery.Think about this, an e-mail written by Zachary for those near and dear to his heart:I am writing to share that I have suddenly gone deaf in my left ear. The condition is called Sudden Sensory Neural Hearing Loss.After consulting with the country\\'s best hearing experts as well as my oncologist, it has been determined that this is unequivocally a latent, long-term side effect of my post-operative cancer treatments from eleven years ago. Evidently, the excessive radiation dosages to the left hemisphere of my brain have caused irreparable neurological damage to my cochlea, which has ceased functioning.There may be options (cochlear implants) but I will not know more for several weeks. As you can imagine, this is a devastating blow to my personal life and music career, especially since I remember fighting so hard to regain dexterity and muscle control in my left hand when it ceased functioning prior to my initial diagnosis in 1995.That said, it has only reinvigorated me to stay the course and continue to advocate on behalf of the more than 500,000 young adults living with, through and beyond cancer each and every year. Now more than ever, I stress the importance of recognizing that remission is not a cure and that public awareness and adequate funding for adolescent and young adult cancer survivorship programming is tantamount to that of cancer research.This is what it means to be a cancer survivor.To read more about Zachary\\'s powerful journey, click here for an unbelievably moving essay -- titled The Cost Of Living: No Cure For Cancer -- written by this unbelievably grounded guy.

       " 'President Bush, in a recent press release, declared April Cancer Control Month. It\\'s a month for educating Americans about cancer, for raising awareness about treatments, for renewing the commitment to fighting this deadly disease.Bush makes no mention in his release of the millions he just cut from the National Cancer Institute budget and how this might hinder this month\\'s initiative, but he does offer a few relatively inexpensive ideas for individuals who wish to minimize their risk of developing the disease that remains the country\\'s second leading cause of death.\"Individuals can reduce their risk of developing cancer by practicing healthy eating habits, exercising, limiting sun exposure, avoiding tobacco, knowing their family history, and getting regular screenings from the doctor,\" he writes.Bush goes on to honor those lost to cancer and commends the strength of the 10 million people in the United States surviving the disease. He extends his gratitude for medical professionals, researchers, family members, and friends who support cancer patients. And he closes with a little history -- and his very own proclamation. \"In 1938, the Congress of the United States passed a joint resolution (52 Stat. 148; 36 U.S.C. 103) as amended, requesting the President to issue an annual proclamation declaring April as \\'Cancer Control Month.\\'NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2007 as Cancer Control Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness about the steps Americans can take to prevent and control cancer.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.\"GEORGE W. BUSH Comments: 1. Money isn\\'t everything. Had a Democrat done the same thing, you would probably be delighted to point out how it encourages awareness and better decision-making. But, like most on the internet and the media, you trample over the truth of the matter to criticize a Republican. Nice going. I\\'ll bet you\\'re even in favor of Canadian style health-care, even though under that cancer victims are really screwed.2. Say what? Since when did this become a political discussion? It seems to me that funding fuels research and research finds cures. If funding cuts are made research will suffer, plain and simple - no matter who makes the cuts. (please don\\'t get me started on stem cell research) And why do some people have such a negative view of the Canadian health system? Some of the world\\'s leading edge researchers and treatment facilities exist in this country. A more meaningful statement would have been - without research, cancer victims from around the world will suffer. My surgeon called cancer the great equalizer. It doesn\\'t matter who you are or where you come from, it is devastating to all. Politics shouldn\\'t even enter into it.3. Wow, koko, you\\'ve read a lot of offense into this. Where is she criticizing Bush? She simply stated that he made no mention of his budget cut. It\\'s true; there\\'s no editorializing about it in this article, as far as I can see, though the fact can certainly raise some passions in a reader. But that\\'s up to the reader.It\\'s also true, as you say, that money isn\\'t eveything. But medical research, as well as medical care on the personal level, can\\'t occur without it. That\\'s not a partisan issue; it\\'s a cold hard fact. If a Democrat had cut that budget, it would be just as cut, and current and future cancer patients just as screwed.Regards,Richard Day Gore 4. It\\'s time to be offensive, or at least go on the offensive about the Administration\\'s neglect of the National Cancer Institute, the Government\\'s engine for cancer research. In 2004 the Administration allowed the NCI\\'s budget to slip below the level of inflation. This continued in 2005, but in 2006 the Administration actually cut the NCI budget. It then proposed virtually the same low level for 2007. The new Congress succeeded in increasing this modestly despite the Administration\\'s objections, but the Administration is trying to roll back funding for 2008 to the proposed 2007 level. President Bush has done a horrible job with the War on Cancer, a war that has far, far more casualties than the war in Iraq or 9/11. Think of it: in just eight days, at about 1,500 cancer deaths daily in the US, total cancer deaths just about double the total deaths in the war to date plus 9/11! I found President Bush\\'s proclamation most hypocritical. We deserve and need better leadership in the War on Cancer! Jim Waldenfels',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve read stories about women whose breast cancer diagnoses were delayed because they explained away certain symptoms. One woman, an athlete, was told by her husband one day that her nipple looked different from the other. \"It\\'s probably just the jog bra I\\'ve been wearing all day,\" she assured him. They both moved on.Some time later, this woman learned that her different nipple was a sign of breast cancer. And she had it. She just didn\\'t know it. And so her diagnosis came late. Eight years later, this young mother of two small children died from a disease she explained away.This is normal -- the art of explaining away all the odd messages our bodies give us. Perhaps it\\'s the stigma of whining about every little ache and pain that keeps us from pursuing immediate medical attention. It could be the likelihood that our complaints are pretty normal, so we refrain from rushing to judgment.I\\'m practicing this well-established art right now. It\\'s odd for me because I\\'ve already had breast cancer, and I am usually ultra-sensitive to every twinge of pain I feel. So when I woke this morning, with a tight and aching feeling in my chest, one would have thought I\\'d be racing out the door, headed for the nearest emergency room. I considered the fact that perhaps I need to be seen, that a chest X-ray might be in order, but I took no action -- because I explained the feeling away. It went something like this:It must be the way I slept. I slept in a different bed, with one child and one dog, and I don\\'t think I moved an inch all night.The feeling gets less intense with time. At this moment, I can only feel something -- and it\\'s very mild -- if I inhale deeply.If I have the same feeling tomorrow morning, I will pursue it -- no, I won\\'t pursue it just yet because I wont\\' be sleeping in my own bed for a few more nights. I\\'ll wait until I get back to my own bed and see what happens. Maybe this bed is not good for me.This goes on and on. For me, I think it happens because I suspect nothing really is wrong with me. Perhaps I am dismissing something serious but mostly, I\\'m chalking this behavior to progress. Because there was a day when I ran to the dentist for a bump on the roof of my mouth -- it was nothing -- and I cried to get myself a next-day mammogram for some lumpy tissue I was convinced was cancer -- it wasn\\'t -- and now, I am happy to feel more like a normal person. I am happy to have perfected my new art, which incidentally I will abandon in an instant if the discomfort persists.My husband says he\\'s had this feeling before when getting out of bed. I think I\\'m going to be OK. Comments: 1. I so hear you, Jackie. All day, every day we\\'re surrounded by whining about petty things, yet we dare not worry aloud about something that could actually be important. Stigma indeed.Regards,Richard Day Gore2.

       " \"It might not be possible at this time to eradicate cancer altogether. But we may be able to stop cancer cells in their tracks through a process called senescence. In senescence, cells don't divide. And when cells don't divide, they don't grow. In such a scenario then, cancer cells wouldn't divide and therefore couldn't grow.Think about this:According to lab tests on mice, triggering senescence in certain cells hampers the growth of some tumors.Researchers at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston are the ones behind the scenes on this project -- the study appears online in EMBO Reports, a publication of the European Molecular Biology Organization -- and all eyes are on the p53 gene.The p53 gene lives within cells and works to nip cancer in the bud by springing to action in damaged cells that may be spinning themselves into a cancer frenzy.Researchers say senescence ordered by the p53 gene is extremely important in suppressing tumor formation and is as important as apoptosis -- a type of programmed cell death. But in some cancers, senescence might not be enough to halt cancer, they found.OK, so senescence is not a perfect approach to halting all cancers. But it seems to work for some -- so I say for now, let's take what we can get. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'All Samantha Kuehn had on her mind when she wore her new t-shirt to school -- with the slogan save the ta-tas plastered across the front -- was her mom, who was diagnosed with breast cancer last month and just received a mastectomy two weeks ago.But officials at Oklahoma Union High School in Nowata County are not happy about the senior student\\'s decision to wear such a shirt to school. The moment they saw it, in fact, they sent her home. And they told her not to return until she changed the shirt.Kuehn and her mom, Michelle Bishop, are stunned that the shirt caused such an uproar.\"I was so surprised that my shirt would cause so much trouble,\" said Samantha. \"Other girls wear low cut shirts or belly shirts and the boys wear shirts with put downs on them and no one bothers them. My shirt isn\\'t really vulgar or offensive at all, and it means something to me. The principal told me \\'It could be taken the wrong way\\'.\"Principal Steven Barth believes he made the right call.\"If you check the Web site, the clothing sold there is suggestive,\" explained Barth. \"I feel for the condition of her mother, but the shirt was inappropriate to wear to school.\"Kuehn and her mom plan to take the matter to a Board of Education meeting on April 11. And you can bet Kuehn will be wearing her shirt.Visit savethetatas.com for more information on this breast cancer initiative. Sales of all clothing items -- pick your size, slogan and color -- benefit the fight against the disease. Comments: 1. Jacki,This is so petty! I have seen t-shirts far more suggestive and so vulgar they shouldn\\'t be allowed to be worn at home let alone in the public!Correct me if I\\'m wrong, but isn\\'t that a cancer insignia in between the word ta-tas? The only thing I see is a young woman expressing and showing her support in the fight against breast cancer. And probably bringing awareness to a lot of her fellow students. I wonder if Mr Barth would have allowed \"save the breasts\"? I really doubt it. I was in the post office buying stamps. I buy breast cancer stamps as my way of supporting breast cancer research. On the stamp itself, shows a woman lying on her side, one arm underneath her head, the other across her side and stomach. She is wearing a shirt or dress with only one strap. To me it is in good taste and a piece of art, the colors, it\\'s a beautiful stamp. However, a woman standing behind me made the remark; it was disgusting,\"it looks as if she is being suggestive sexually, or she is going to feel her own breasts\". I turned around, and said \"I think she is beautiful, and one usually has to touch ones self in order to perform a self examination, the stamp does relate to breast cancer and awareness mam.\" The postmaster applauded as did others.My point being, everybody will see things differently through their own eye\\'s, right or wrong, or just plain ignorance. This Mr Steven Barth sounds like a true ignoramus just as the woman in the post office.Both Samantha and especially her mother have a fight ahead of them. I wish them both wellness, and strength. Looking forward to the day when Samantha wears her \"save the ta-tas\" t-shirt back to school. What if all of Samantha\\'s friends got together, well, everybody wear the t-shirt. What are they going to do? Expel all the students?My prayers are with you both,Take care all, Sincerely Jason ',\n",

       " \"I've been wearing a breast cancer bracelet that jingles with charms in the shapes of hearts, with inspiring little messages like Go with your heart. One of the heart charms is a watch. My friend sent me this shortly after my breast cancer diagnosis. I love this bracelet. So I was sad the other day when the glass piece covering the watch somehow cracked and shattered. I only realized this when I tried to check the time and learned that my watch was not actually telling time anymore. So I went for my back-up -- another watch, exactly the same and also given to me as a gift. I replaced my old watch with the new watch and then days later, my new watch was not working. I think water got inside the glass and damaged the battery or the mechanisms -- or something. I'm sure I could repair the watches -- and I considered this -- but then it entered my mind that maybe this is a message that I am okay now without all my breast cancer gear.Maybe my need for all things breast cancer is not as critical as it once was. Like my rubbery, pink bracelet that reads Spread beauty. Share hope. I once wore it every day. Now I can't find it. And like the&nbsp; bracelet I made myself, with pink and white and silver beads and one special bead that reads Hope. I still have it. It sits in my medicine cabinet. And I don't wear it. I have also found that I am forgetting important information about my cancer. My mom and I were talking about breast cancer the other day -- and I could not remember what kind of cancer I had. I have since remembered -- invasive ductal carcinoma -- but I went blank at the time. I couldn't recall it from memory -- yet there was a time when I could recite every fact and figure related to my diagnosis. Now that time has passed, things are getting blurry and my personal adornments are falling by the wayside. My breast cancer purse has been replaced by a new purse my sister gave me. My breast cancer candle has completely burned out. My Cancer Center parking pass is no longer active. My numbing cream -- for my port -- is about to expire.Perhaps this all has something to do with the end of my treatment -- which came yesteray with my last of 17 doses of Herceptin. Perhaps the end of my treatment journey -- where material things kept me inspired and motivated and focused -- is giving way to a new chapter in my life. Perhaps I will be okay now on my own -- without inspiring messages and jewelry and pink candles. And without treatment. Only time will tell. And I plan to pay little attention to the time. I just plan to enjoy my time -- without urgency, without stress, without keeping track. Without a watch. Comments: 1.

There are no great screening tests to pick up on its presence in the body, and by the time symptoms appear, the disease has often progressed into an advanced stage. But a ray of light has recently emerged in the study of ovarian cancer -- and it could help in the prevention and early detection of this deadly disease.Think about this, from the April 2007 issue of Woman's Day magazine:Researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine have identified a simple checklist of six symptoms associated with an increased risk of the disease and three of them -- if they occur at least 12 times per month and are present for less than one year -- were present 57 percent of the time in a study of women with early-stage disease.And the three symptoms are: abdominal and pelvic pain, bloating and difficulty eating, and feeling full quickly.If you experience these problems, especially if they are frequent or new, contact your doctor because identifying ovarian cancer quickly is key.

Now just over 2 months later, a hysterectomy past, and having just finished her second Chemo, had she only worried about the short checklist here, she would have had an exploded cancer filled cyst within her and an even lower chance of survival. \",\n",

Now, thanks to this spunky gal, there's a whole Cancer Schmancer movement taking place, a movement that will culminate this June with the launch of a non-profit organization with the name of -- you guessed it -- Cancer Schmancer.Drescher says Cancer Schmancer is all about the politics of cancer education and funding, screening tests, early detection, the removal of carcinogens from women's products, and the often-dismissed truth that young women do get cancer.Drescher, who for two years fought with doctors who persisted she was too young for uterine cancer -- she wasn't -- says her organization will raise awareness and change health policy to better promote diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of womens' cancers.

Will sunscreen save my life or cause malignant lesions to develop on my fair skin?I honestly don\\'t know what to think about these questions -- or the handful of new ones that just came to my attention.There\\'s the one about eggs. Some say they cause a rise in cholesterol. But now I learn that when eaten in moderation -- about two per day -- eggs do not contain enough cholesterol to do any damage.Then there\\'s the carbs.

Jacki,I\\'ve read about everything mentioned in this article. Some of the info was new to me. All in all I would have to agree with you on moderation. Funny, I was thinking about some changes in my own diet as well.Before and after my diagnosis of severe liver dysfunction, I was on a normal diet, without added sodium, and would eat foods that are easy to digest. When going on a strict diet of only vegetables, fruit, a lot of water, I noticed that my body and physical being started feeling weaker.My liver readings have not changed, if they do, they only increase. Realizing every person will react differently to special diets; and just being on a normal diet, I have found that I had a little more energy, my color was better. Red meat does not agree with me, so fish or chicken replaces the red meat.It is overwhelming how many food products and skin products can be related to causing cancer. Not knowing what to eat, what medications, and there are quite a few of those that can cause serious problems including cancer. It really is quite stressful just thinking about these things let alone having to live by these diets and regiments.Other obvious products to stay away from are lawn products and the pesticides, I say this because having used them for many yrs, I am now paying for it, my lungs are diseased as well.There are people that have to stay on these particular regiments the rest of their lives, and I feel for them. But if they are comfortable and feel well, then they should continue, do whatever it takes to be healthy and happy without stress!So, I will end this by saying thanks for this article. It confirms what I have been feeling for awhile now. No need to over-do, just eat sensibly, along with veggies and greens and fruits &amp; as you said in moderation',\n",

Comments: 1. Jacki, Thanks for your post, especially your remark about alcohol consumption.The role of alcohol consumption and cancer is not limited to poorer countries. The affluent educated community of Marin County, California has a risk of breast cancer of one in four women. One of the possible factors this has been attributed to is the elevated alcohol intake in women in Marin County relative to other areas.Overall, in the U.S., alcohol intake is responsible for 3.6 percent of cancer deaths.

Jacki,Having lived in Marin county a good portion of my life, there was always a lot of drinking, parties everywhere, anytime. Most being college students or graduates. Of course that was many yrs ago, it doesn\\'t seem as though it\\'s changed much at all.I can say the same about W.S.U. and surrounding areas of Seattle, highly educated young women and men, doing that binge drinking. Parties everywhere, graduates, and students again. Not only does this contribute to breast cancer, this so-called binge drinking is killing our young adults, our future.There is constant advertising on the abuse of alcohol here among the graduates, but there is not really an advertisment on it\\'s relationship to cancer. How do you explain that? What makes the news? Alcohol abuse? Not alcohol &amp; cancer. What\\'s wrong with this picture.Thank you Jason',\n",
       " \"Diana Dyer was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer, when she was six months old. She was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 34. She was diagnosed with a second breast cancer ten years after the first. Each cancer was treated by conventional medicine and included combinations of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. But because her cancer kept returning, Diana realized that for her, something other then treatment was necessary to sustain her through a long life. So she considered a healthy recipe for living -- a blend of traditional medicine and alternative methods too -- and she implemented a holistic approach to healing into her personal world. She has not had a recurrence since 1995 -- and she credits this to the changes she's made in her life. She has tipped the scales in her favor, she believes, and she shares her approach with others who want to begin a journey toward recovery and healing after cancer.Diana is a cancer and nutrition specialist and has written a book called A Dietitian's Cancer Story. Diana shares with her readers her approach to lifestyle changes -- including diet, exercise, meditation, and other techniques that she now calls complementary and not alternative. Her techniques can be used during active treatment and during recovery from treatment. Diana shares recipes and sample menus and her thoughts on support groups and homeopathy and prayer and reading and nature too. Diana has a wealth of knowledge that fills the pages of her book -- and much of her story can be found on her website too, where I learned that proceeds from Diana's book go to an endowment fund she established at The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) in Washington DC. Called the Diana Dyer Cancer Survivor's Nutrition and Cancer Research Endowment, it helps fund research projects for nutritional strategies to increase long-term survival after a cancer diagnosis.

       " 'Results of two studies, sponsored by the Adjuvant Breast Cancer (ABC) Trials Collaborative Group, conclude that adding chemotherapy to the estrogen-blocking drug tamoxifen improves survival for those with early-stage breast cancer. The same studies reveal preventing the secretion of estrogen from the ovaries does not offer much benefit for most women.Researchers studied 1991 patients, ages 28 to 81. All had received five years worth of treatment with tamoxifen therapy with or without standard chemotherapy. Some premenopausal women were also treated with ovarian removal (ablation) or suppression, a technique used to stop the glands from secreting hormones.While early results, appearing in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, fell short of statistical significance, chemotherapy still reduced the overall risk of death by 17 percent, mostly for women younger than 50 and especially for premenopausal women not treated with ovarian ablation or suppression. ___FCKsi___3&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img width=1 height=1 alt=\"\" src=\"http://us.bc.yahoo.com/b?P=Cto3VUSOwhX8OjckQD.BAxA0GKrAiEYU.bgAAeF4&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;T=18oloubk5%2fX%3d1175779768%2fE%3d7666449%2fR%3dnews%2fK%3d5%2fV%3d2.1%2fW%3dH%2fY%3dYAHOO%2fF%3d1122275479%2fH%3dY2FjaGVoaW50PSJuZXdzIiBjb250ZW50PSJkcnVnO2JyZWFzdCBjYW5jZXI7QnJlYXN0IENhbmNlcjt0cmlhbDtDYW5jZXI7Y2FuY2VyO2l0O21lbm9wYXVzZTsiIHJlZnVybD0iIiB0b3BpY3M9IiI-%2fQ%3d-1%2fS%3d1%2fJ%3d66C28E44&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;U=13a3mvkbg%2fN%3dxNXvJdG_fzY-%2fC%3d568450.9739544.10710891.6052652%2fD%3dLREC%2fB%3d4290323\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Comments: ',\n",

       " 'You\\'ve surely known kids whose parents smoke declare their repulsion for the habit. The health risk, the expense, the filth of smoking seem to deter many youngsters from following in the footsteps of mom and dad. Theoretically, anyway. In practice, these same kids may fall prey to the very act they vowed to reject. How about kids raised in households filled with sugary snacks and drinks, foods packed with fat, salt, and calories, and parents with expanding waistlines? Seems only natural these children, despite good intentions, end up struggling with healthful eating and weight management.We are what our parents teach us. It\\'s all we know for a good many years. And by the time we are able to make our own independent decisions, it\\'s often too late. Our parents\\' actions and values are already programmed within us -- and it takes hard work to switch things up.So here\\'s my plea for this Sunday morning: do your kids a favor and become a positive role model. Don \\'t just tell your little ones what is right and healthy and virtuous -- show them. Let your behavior be the gold standard now, so that later, it\\'s likely to be what your sweet babies will fall back on.Here are seven ways to get started:Feed \\'em wellIf kids learn healthy eating habits early, they\\'re likely to stick with them. Offer whole grains options (rice, bread, pasta) and snacks that are not in the junk food group. Don\\'t even buy the stuff you may later wish to clear out of your cupboard. Guests at our house are offered two drink options -- water or milk. Why? Because if we have juice (it\\'s loaded with sugar) or soda (also sugary and calorie-laden), our kids just can\\'t hold back. But if we don\\'t have these beverages, they are never an option. Out of sight, out of mind.Keep \\'em movingTake your kids to the park, get them running around your backyard, take them swimming, organize a kid-friendly football game, invest in a kite. Quiet activities are also good -- and necessary -- but when in doubt about how to entertain your busy little bees, make them move!Let \\'em see you sweatYou need to keep moving too. Not only for your own well-being -- that\\'s obvious -- but so your kids see your physical activity as a staple of healthy living. Teach your kids to do push-ups and sit-ups and do them together. Jump rope, run laps at a local track, ride bikes, or dance. Just don\\'t expect your kids to stay active if your idea of exercise is flipping through TV channels.No TVTurn off that TV. Rid your household of junk-food commercials, mind-numbing content, and addictive inactivity. Let TV be a treat -- a small one -- and not an expectation.No smokingNeed I explain? It\\'s unhealthy, costly, dirty, and a sure contributor to cancer. Try with every ounce of your being to keep this habit away from your impressionable children.No stressSome stress is unavoidable. Some is even healthy. But the kind of stress that hurts our tummies, gives us headaches, and threatens our health should be minimized. We must do our best to control our own stress so its effects don\\'t spill over. And we must teach our kids how to cope too. Fortunately, some of the techniques listed above also work for this category -- physical activity, for example, does wonders for lowering stress. We can become experts at deep breathing -- have your kids practice with you. And we can teach a bit of distraction. If homework is making kids crazy, go with them on a short walk where they can regroup and return to the task with a clear head.No double standardsWe simply cannot say one thing and do another. Smoking while preaching the dangers of the habit just doesn\\'t make sense. Saying \"no\" to sweets with your hand in the cookie jar is downright unfair. Carrying around extra weight and demanding physical fitness is simply ineffective. So make a commitment to yourself and your kids that you will do as you say. It\\'s the only way. Comments: 1. Michael Torchia, Health Advocate, Submits Bill Proposal to Gov. Schwarzenegger to Help Campaign to Combat Epidemic of ObesityMichael Torchia, Health and Wellness Expert, who founded \"Children\\'s Fitness Academy\" to help fight the epidemic of childhood obesity, created a bill to reform and create stricter guidelines for the manufacture of packaged foods. He is requesting stricter Guidelines for manufacturers, distributors and marketers of foods that contain toxic ingredients so that they will be held accountable for their products.Los Angeles, CA. April 5, 2007 -- Michael Torchia, Health and Wellness Expert, founder of Children\\'s Fitness Academy, is requesting help from Governor Schwarzenegger by asking him to submit a bill through his office to help regulate the activities of the giant food manufacturers. â\\x80¨â\\x80¨Torchia feels Governor Schwarzenegger, as a famous and immediately recognizable civic leader, he -- more effectively than anyone else -- can help end the American epidemic of obesity. Torchia says, \"As Governor of California, he has the power to influence, inspire and motivate people from all walks of life. I remember how he inspired me when I was 15 years old. Because of the Governor, I pursued my dream to compete in bodybuilding. And just as he has given back to the community, he motivated me to share with others all that I\\'ve learned in the field of health and wellness. It\\'s clear to me that we both share a desire to see a healthier America, one in which obesity is not such an alarmingly serious health issue.\"â\\x80¨â\\x80¨The time has come in this country for a cultural shift toward health and wellness and away from the inherent dangers of obesity. Torchia proposes that legislation be enacted in California which forces food manufacturers to add warning labels to all food and beverage products containing ingredients known to be toxic to the human body. Food manufacturers and distributors, as well as any group making claims about the healthfulness of a food product, would have to follow strict regulations regarding those claims. They would also be required to provide guidelines for healthy, age-appropriate consumption of their products. â\\x80¨â\\x80¨People are unknowingly consuming goods, which directly and adversely affect their health. With this legislation, Torchia hopes to make Californians -- and eventually all Americans -- aware of the fact that long-term consumption of trans fats, artificial sweeteners and food dyes can lead to obesity and to the development of Metabolic Syndrome-X (MSX). This is a condition which weakens immune systems and makes people much more susceptible to type-2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and other crippling lifestyle diseases. Producers, distributors, and marketers of foods that contain toxins leading to the development of MSX should be held accountable for the ingredients in their products. Torchia says, \"If we are successful, these manufacturers will be forced to reformulate their food products and provide healthier choices for consumers.\"â\\x80¨â\\x80¨Today, we are inundated with endless \"convenient\" food choices, many of which are extremely unhealthy. This coupled with the fact that most Americans say they are too busy for regular exercise, has helped to create a society of roughly 62 million obese adults. Further, the government\\'s out-of-date healthy-eating guidelines make little sense to most people, Torchia said. And while public awareness of obesity may be increasing, the numbers of so-called \"solutions\" to this social problem are also increasing, with little positive results. This legislation would help people make healthy and informed choices about what they eat. Limiting toxins in our foods will allow people to live healthier, happier and more productive lives, he said. With political support on this life-or-death issue can be the start of a cultural shift in this country toward health and wellness. â\\x80¨â\\x80¨Legislation is a great first step toward solving the obesity epidemic, but education and awareness on a child-by-child basis are the keys to creating a healthier nation, he said. With that goal in mind, Torchia created \"Children\\'s Fitness Academy\" (CFA), an innovative resource public and private schools can use to implement health and fitness education programs. CFA\\'s team of professional fitness and education experts will work with schools to revise and update California\\'s physical education programs as well as provide informative and engaging seminars on career opportunities in the health and fitness arena. In addition, a CFA task force will work to help implement awareness on a statewide level, Torchia said. Members of the task force will conduct research and police those targeted by the legislation, reporting their findings to your office, to the USDA, as well as to children and parents so that healthy and informed choices can be made. Torchia says, \"As you can see, there is much work to be done to create this cultural shift. With CFA\\'s unique plan for creating a healthier nation and political leadership, I believe we can guide the country toward a healthier way of life that will surely benefit those struggling to overcome obesity as well as generations of Americans to come. â\\x80¨â\\x80¨For further information: â\\x80¨Company Name: Children\\'s Fitness AcademyContact: Michael Torchiaâ\\x80¨Office: 310.650.5595â\\x80¨Website: www.operationfitness.comâ\\x80¨ ',\n",

This damage, leading to an increased risk of developing cancer, makes it highly plausible these children may be diagnosed with the disease in mid and late adulthood.Two new studies indicate there are cancer-causing effects of transplacental exposure to AZT, an antiretroviral drug. These effects -- like increased incidence of tumors and tumors with genetic changes -- have been demonstrated in mice and rats and seem to be cause for concern in humans too.\"The cumulative mutagenesis data suggest that infants exposed transplacentally to AZT may be at increased risk for cancer as they age,\" said one researcher, whose findings are published in Environment and Molecular Mutagenesis.

       " \"It's been a rough road for former Boise State basketball player Coby Karl, son of Denver Nuggets coach George Karl. The younger Karl, 23, had his thyroid removed 13 months ago due to papillary carcinoma, a treatable form of cancer. And he returned to the operating room just last week for the removal of cancerous lymph nodes.Karl's recent surgery, intended to take two to three hours, lasted for seven hours. This worried Dad.''When it goes longer and longer, you always think the worst, and start worrying about things like being under anesthesia that long and all the nightmares you have about surgeries,'' George Karl said.But it turns out Coby was just fine -- doctors just wanted to be thorough -- and the ambitious young man plans to play ball as soon as possible.Coby is expected to remain inactive for 10 days to two weeks. But after that, he is free to do whatever he wants. And what the 6-foot-4 guard wants to do is start working out in hopes of getting drafted by an NBA team.''He is anxious to get into the NBA thing and celebrate basketball by trying to make it in this league,'' his dad says. Comments: ''When it goes longer and longer, you always think the worst, and start worrying about things like being under anesthesia that long and all the nightmares you have about surgeries,'' George Karl said.''He is anxious to get into the NBA thing and celebrate basketball by trying to make it in this league,'' his dad says.1. I'm a huge basketball fan, (and Nuggets fan, amongst other teams) and I'm sitting here watching the playoffs as I write this. I just saw the story about George and Coby Karl and this inspired my to look up more information, which is how I've come across this blog. I just wanted to say how much I admire Coby's attitude, strength, and motivation in dealing with a situation that can be so difficult, especially for someone so young. I know, I've been there. I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer when I was 20. I have been in remission for many years now. The experience changed my life and gave me astounding strength I had no idea I possessed. I just want to say how good it is to see Coby and his father George handling this with so much strength and positivity. Every person who is known and respected publicly willing to talk openly about their experiences with cancer make it just a bit easier for the rest of us to understand and deal with our own experiences. I admire Coby's determination and positive outlook, and I admire his father's (and I'm sure, the rest of his family's) support and strength. Support is one of the most important aspects of recovery. Go Nuggets! 2. I was also diagnosed with thyroid cancer when I was 19 years old. It has been 8 years now and I have had a re-accurance almost every year. I have had 4 surgeries and 4 radiation treatments. I was told that this type of cancer either never comes back, or will keep coming back and mine has come back several times. I can understand what Coby is going through. I love the Nuggets and I think that George Carl is one of the best coaches that the Nuggets have had in years. Coby Carl would be a great addition to the Nuggets, as long as there is no favoritism from Georg Carl. Coby Carl has been very strong with going through two surgerys in about one year. It is very hard, especially when I have a wife and kids. Good luck to Coby and his family. 3. James,Thanks for sharing your own struggles. I will say a prayer for your continued recovery and success in dealing with this obstacle. People like you give others strength and courage to deal with their own issues. \",\n",
       " \"It feels like summer here in Florida. Our temps topped 86 degrees last week and this kind of heat prompts my little boys to request their favorite summertime activity: swimming.My kids don't quite understand that the temperature outside is not the same as the temperature of unheated water. And so as soon as warm weather arrives, they dash for their suits and insist we make a trip to the neighborhood pool. I oblige, convinced they'll want to head home once they submerge their piggy toes in pure ice.But somehow, the temperature doesn't register. They plunge right in, dunk their heads and kick and flop and float. They are happy as clams, quivering lips and all. I am happy too as I watch their joyous moments from the privacy of my lounge chair, tucked away in the shade that borders my kids' perfect playland.Thanks to chemo, I am the mommy who hides in the shadows during any sunny event. It's been two whole years since my last dose of toxic drugs, but something about the sun and the heat and the residual effects of my infused poison causes my skin to produce red, itchy, unsightly bumps. It happened last year and already this year and I'm wondering now if this will be a life-long nuisance, if I will be seeking shade for the rest of my years.It's all OK really. Secluding myself from the sun's rays is a pretty healthy venture. And I'm not a real pool enthusiast. Any my boys are old enough to swim independently. And it's peaceful in the shade. So I'm not bitter about this unexpected side effect of chemo -- it's called UV recall -- and I'm not complaining. I'm merely marveling at the power of the drugs that hopefully killed all the cancer in my body, the drugs that seem to creep back year after year, perhaps reminding me that in the whole scheme of things, red, itchy, unsightly bumps are not such a bad life condition.

But not long after I finished doing some research yesterday on breast cancer screening tools did I realize the statistics on breast cancer incidence have changed for 2007. Not only did they change -- they\\'re moving in exactly the right direction.Think about this:The American Cancer Society reports that 178,480 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in American women in 2007. This number was 212,920 in 2006. Deaths by breast cancer -- there were 40,970 in 2006 -- will number 40,910 this year.Just as it had become second nature for me to rattle off 200,000 as the general number of women diagnosed with breast cancer each year, I must learn a new number. I love it. Comments: 1. Happy news indeed!and the Canadian Cancer Society says that Canada\\'s death rates from breast cancer are down 25% over the past 20 years as well. The CCS says the age-standardized death rate has fallen to about 22 cases per 100,000 from 30 since 1986, a drop of 25 per cent, and that 86 per cent of women now survive at least five years after a diagnosis.These improved numbers are attributed to better screening and better treatment. Isn\\'t progress grand!2. So now the American Cancer Society has taken up fortune telling? Folks, I don\\'t want to rain on anybody\\'s parade, but 2007 ain\\'t over yet.

       " \"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will take an additional three months to review Wyeth's kidney cancer drug Torisel -- the first of five new medications the company plans to introduce this year.The FDA needs more time to investigate data on tumor growth in patients taking Torisel. If all goes well, the drug will be one of only three to effectively hold off incurable kidney cancer. The other two drugs are Pfizer's Sutent and Bayer AG's Nexavar.Robert Ruffolo, president of Wyeth Research, says he is encouraged by the review process so far. And he is optimistic about launching the product in late 2007.Studies show Torisel, which will cost patients about $30,000 per year, prolonged survival by 50 percent in those faring poorly with kidney cancer. The sickest kidney-cancer patients were essentially kept alive for 10.9 months, compared with 7.3 months with interferon drugs. Torisel also postponed tumor growth for 5.5 months. This is 77 percent longer than with interferon. Sutent and Nexavar, both on the market since last year, also slow tumor growth. All three kidney-cancer medicines are of the variety that block the growth of cancer cells -- different from standard chemotherapy which kills tumors and harms nearby tissues too.Wyeth is relatively new to the oncology market. And soon, the company hopes to launch three more cancer drugs. One, called CMC-544, treats non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Another, SKI-606, is for chronic myelogenous leukemia.

It\\'s also failed to grow ImClone\\'s market -- not surprising since it\\'s the company\\'s only drug.Imclone, partnering with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., wanted to see Erbitux -- already cleared for use with colon, head, and neck cancers -- extend the lives of patients with cancer marked by a spread to the pancreas.No one is giving up just yet, and Imclone plans additional tests on Erbitux\\'s use in pancreatic cancer. A study using a combination of Erbitux and Avastin and chemotherapy is up next.\"There are reasons to think Erbitux works in pancreatic cancer, but the current results are not as dramatic as we hoped,\" said Alex Denner, lead for an executive committee that manages ImClone. \"We remain committed to evaluating Erbitux in pancreatic cancer.\"If approved, Erbitux will compete with Tarceva, sold by Roche Holding AG, Genentech Inc., and OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. as a treatment for pancreatic and lung cancers.About 37,170 new cases of pancreatic cancer are expected to occur in 2007 in the United States. And 33,370 people will die from the disease, according to the American Cancer Society. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers, and there is no screening option that works at catching the disease in its early stages. Only about 5 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer are still alive five years after being diagnosed. Comments: Only about 5 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer are still alive five years after being diagnosed.1. Oncologists prescribe patients one standard empiric chemotherapy regimen after another, until they find one that works. This often can expose patients to the side effects of chemotherapy, without showing any cancer-killing results. Guesswork can be done in a laboratory instead.The tactic of using biopsied cells to predict which cancer treatments will work best for the patient, by taking pieces of \"fresh\" tumor tissue, apply different chemotherapy treatments to it and examine the results to see which drug or combination of drugs do the best job killing the tumor cells.An example of this testing, researchers have tested how well women with relapsed ovarian cancer would respond to a combination of a pancreatic cancer drug and an ovarian cancer drug. They found the combination worked on a number of women, and testing cells in petri dishes predicted which women would respond to this combination and which wouldn\\'t.Or a metastatic pancreatic cancer patient can be treated successfully with a combination of drugs commonly used to fight lung, pancreatic, breast and colorectal cancers.There are pre-tests that can report to a physician specifically which chemotherapy agent would benefit a cancer patient by testing that patientâ\\x80\\x99s \"live\" cancer cells. Drug sensitivity profiles differ significantly among cancer patients even when diagnosed with the same cancer.Knowing the drug sensitivity profile of a specific cancer patient allows the treating oncologists to prescribe chemotherapy that will be the most effective against the tumor cells of that patient.2. There\\'s no evidence that pre-testing on pancreatic and ovarian cells has any benefit.None.Perhaps, in the future, but not now.3. Apparently Medicare contractor, National Heritage Insurance Company, which spent six months reviewing everything about pre-testing assays, thinks there is benefit of these tests. The decision had been made that the assay is a perfectly appropriate medical service, worthy of coverage on a non-investigational basis. What is of particular significance is that they are finally abandoning the artificial distinction between \"resistance\" testing and \"sensitivity\" testing and are providing coverage for the whole FDA-approved kit.4. I wouldn\\'t say that a decision by a local Medicare contractor means that the chemotherapy assays have benefit. It\\'s certainly not a National Medicare decision. I mean, Medicare covers many \"therapies\" (some obesity treatments, tobacco dependence treatment, some mental health therapies, heart and lung rehab, i.e. expensive exercise) that have been proven to be of little or no benefit. Even,you, yourself, claim that many chemotherapeutic agents have no benefit yet Medicare covers them.So, you couldn\\'t possibly be indicating that a Medicare position on chemosensitivity has any validity, could you?Unfortunately, at this time, there is no evidence at all of benefit to chemoresistance testing. A March 2007 update is located here:<A href=\"http://www.regence.com/trgmedpol/lab/lab06.html\" rel=nofollow>http://www.regence.com/trgmedpol/lab/lab06.html</A>5. ASCO and BC/BS\\'s position paper focused on an older cell-growth assay method, and not on a newer cell-death method, which is the most relevant biological measure. In fact, when most academic oncologists refer to \"chemosensitivity testing,\" they are virtually always referring to and thinking about \"the human tumor stem cell assay\" or \" the clonogenic assay,\" yet this technology hasn\\'t been used by any private sector laboratory for more than 15 years.Their panel made no attempt to distinguish cell-death from cell-growth techniques. Their conclusions simply did not apply to cell-death assays. In fact, cell-death assay results have consistently correlated with response, time to progression, and overall survival. Excluded from consideration in their tech assessments of Cell Culture Assays were studies which relate to the performance characteristics (predictive accuracy, sensitivity and specificity).National Heritage Insurance Company (NHIC) found this omission so significant that they carefully documented the historical progression of Medicare policy dating from the \"colony assays\" of the 1970\\'s to the noncoverage-National Coverage Decision regarding \"stem cell\" assays (1980), to the 1999 National Medicare Coverage Advisory Committee review, to the initial coverage by NHIC in the late 2000, to their present comprehensive review.Medicare coverage has always been available for drug resistance testing since 2000 for a tumor specimen from a Medicare patient obtained anywhere within the United States, but submitted for testing by one of the approved laboratories located within California.It was unfortunate that ASCO and BC/BS had not carried out studies to assess the value of cell-death assays, because they can and do accurately predict clinical outcomes and define novel chemotherapeutic synergies. In many cases, these same tests have induced highly durable remissions in patients whom current medical literature have deemed otherwise hopeless.6. \"not a single diagnostic test in history has been shown to improve outcomes.\"huh? OK, everybody. No more colonoscopies for you!\"Everyone is scared to death at what is going to happen to the healthcare economic system with the introduction of increasingly expensive new drugs..\"Really? Who?For twelve years after its discovery, not enough penicillin existed to save even one person, yet over twelve billion units of penicillin can be made each year now, and at a cost of ONLY 3% of what it had cost during the war. We\\'ve heard this all before.\"It should serve their interest not only in discovering new cancer treatments, but also using currently-available cell culture technologies to improve the effectiveness of existing drugs..\"There\\'s no evidence at this time that these offer any benefit. None. So why should I, as a taxpayer, pay for a completely unproven test? Let\\'s let the studies begin and complete before I pay big bucks for an unproven test or unproven \"therapy\" like Essiac tea or a psychic healer, etc.7. Aetna\\'s recent reimbursement policy regarding medical tests require \"demonstrated improvement in clinical outcomes.\" However, not a single diagnostic test in history has been shown to improve outcomes. The smoking gun of hypocracy is in their guidelines for molecular tests. With the new gene-based tests, the language was altered to read \"anticipated\" or \"expected\" improvements in treatment outcomes. While the language for cellular-based tests still reads \"proven\" improvements in treatment outcomes.Everyone is scared to death at what is going to happen to the healthcare economic system with the introduction of increasingly expensive new drugs that benefit only a small percentage of patients who receive them, hence the headlong rush to develop tests to identify molecular predisposing mechanisms whose presence still does not guarantee that a drug will be effective for an individual patient. Nor can they, for any patient or even large groups of patients, discriminate the potential for clinical activity among different agents of the same class.However, profit is a powerful motivating force. Among the payors, the profit motive is entirely consistent with the goal of the test, which is to identify efficacious therapies irrespective of drug mark-up rates.The FDA finds themselves under increasing pressure to allow new drugs into the marketplace while at the same time protecting the safety of potential recipients of those drugs and also the financial interests of those who will have to pay for them.It explains the new paradigm of requiring a companion diagnostic as a condition for approval of new targeted therapies. The pressure is so great that the companion diagnostics they\\'ve approved often have been mostly or totally ineffective at identifying clinical responders (durable and otherwise) to the various therapies.It should be in the FDA\\'s interest in saving the healthcare system perhaps billions of dollars a year (and thereby the healthcare system itself) by ensuring that expensive treatments are used appropriately. It should serve their interest not only in discovering new cancer treatments, but also using currently-available cell culture technologies to improve the effectiveness of existing drugs and save lives today by administering the right drug to the right patient at the right time.8. \"In many cases, these same tests have induced highly durable remissions in patients whom current medical literature have deemed otherwise hopeless.\"There is not a lick of evidence at this time that this is in any way true. Notice that no data accompanies the above post (because there is none). This is why scientists, researchers, and physicians await the data before making statements like the above and before there is widespread approval for these expensive tests. Until then, be careful what you read. It\\'s not that one should understand that this blog is, as indicated above, for \"informational purposes only,\" but one should also understand that this information can be misleading. We should call the posters on this. Let\\'s hope for ever greater cancer breakthroughs. However, we need to be smart about it.9. The methods of cancer medicine during the last thirty some years are coming to haunt the \"one-size-fits-all\" establishment. Technologies, developed over the last twenty years by private researchers, hold the key to solving some of the problems confronting a healthcare system that is seeking ways to best allocate available resources while accomplishing the critical task of matching individual patients with the treatments most likely to benefit them.10. The effects of drugs targeting EGF (Iressa, Tarceva, Erbitux) are poorly predicted by measuring the ostensible target (EGFR), but can be predicted more accurately by measuring the effect of the drugs on the function of live cells. One gets more accurate information when using intact RNA isolated from \"fresh\" tissue than from using degraded RNA, which is present in paraffin-fixed tissue.Cell Function Analysis tells us that Whole Cell Profiling measures the response of the tumor cells to drug exposure. Following this exposure, they measure both cell metabolism and cell morphology. The integrated effect of the drugs on the whole cell, resulting in a cellular response to the drug, measuring the interaction of the entire genome. No matter which genes are being affected, Whole Cell Profiling is measuring them through the surrogate of measuring if the cell is alive or dead.For example, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a protein on the surface of a cell. EGFR inhibiting drugs certainly do target specific genes, but even knowing what genes the drugs target doesn\\'t tell you the whole story. Both Iressa and Tarceva target EGFR protein-tyrosine kinases. But all the EGFR mutation or amplificaton studies can tell us is whether or not the cells are potentially susceptible to this mechanism of attack.It doesn\\'t tell you if Iressa is better or worse than Tarceva or other drugs which may target this. There are differences. The drugs have to get inside the cells in order to target anything. So, in different tumors, either Iressa or Tarceva might get in better or worse than the other. And the drugs may also be inactivated at different rates, also contributing to sensitivity versus resistance.There are many pathways to altered cellular (forest) function (hence all the different \"trees\" which correlate in different situations). It serves to validate Whole Cell Profiling. The forest is looked at, and not the trees. Whole Cell Profiling measures what happens at the end (the effects on the forest), rather than the status of the individual trees.Cancer is a complex disease and needs to be attacked on many fronts. The best thing to do is to combine these different tests in ways which make the most sense. The future of cancer therapy will be personalized treatments for individual patients, and will require a combination of novel diagnostics and therapeutics.Improving cancer patient diagnosis and treatment through a combination of cellular and gene-based testing will offer predictive insight into the nature of an individual\\'s particular cancer and enable oncologists to prescribe treatment more in keeping with the heterogeneity of the disease. The biologies are very different and the response to given drugs is very different.',\n",
       " \"Red meat makes headlines -- again -- due to new research indicating it increases a woman's chances of developing breast cancer. I've heard this before. Maybe that's because it's becoming pretty conclusive.Findings are most significant for post-menopausal women because these are the women with the highest rates of consumption -- about one portion of red meat per day. This daily doses puts them at a 56 percent greater risk than women who eat no red meat.Researchers at the University of Leeds followed the eating habits and health of more than 35,000 women over the past seven years to gather their data, published in the British Journal of Cancer.

       " 'Is there a link between breast cancer and abortion? This is the first of I\\'ve heard of it -- and I consider myself fairly well-versed in the topic of breast cancer. Maybe I missed a beat somewhere along the line.Think about this:There is a Coalition on Abortion/Breast Cancer out there and Karen Malec, head of the group, says there would be far fewer breast cancer cases and deaths if women had been told the truth in the 1980s when conclusive evidence linked abortion with the disease.Malec reports that government scientists wrote a letter in 1986 to the British journal Lancet, acknowledging that abortion causes breast cancer. She says as of 2006, eight medical organizations had recognized abortion as one cause of the disease.Now this has nothing to do with delaying pregnancy until later in life -- also a known risk factor. Abortion stands on its own and is problematic because carrying a pregnancy to term is what protects against breast cancer, says Malec.The American Cancer Society (ACS) does not agree and stands behind several studies backed by strong data concluding induced abortions have no overall effect on the risk of breast cancer.Malec says such studies are seriously flawed.\"We call on the Society and other cancer businesses to put their priorities in order,\" she says. \"Women\\'s lives and cancer prevention are more important than making money, doing cancer walks, and protecting the abortion and pharmaceutical industries.\" Malec also condemns Susan G. Komen For the Cure for donating money to Planned Parenthood -- a group she calls the nation\\'s leading abortion business.\"It\\'s unthinkable that groups that claim to want to eradicate the disease would help fund a cancer-causing organization, especially when the funds could be directed to legitimate health organizations.\"Unthinkable?

Old news. The American Cancer Society is a non-profit. Thankfully, and smartly, they are not going to risk a hit in their funding by raising such a poltical firestorm. Until people on BOTH sides of the aborion debate are mature enough to deal with whatever facts come out of such a study, such a study will NEVER be done :(5. Personally I don\\'t think there is a connection. I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in January. When I told my ultra-religious mother the first thing she wanted to know was if I had ever had an abortion! Not how are you doing, but if I had had an abortion. Since we aren\\'t super close, I don\\'t think she believed my answer of \"No\". She reads all the hype, and believes every word. It\\'s a disservice to have \"reasons\" and \"causes\" out there. People get cancer, the WHY of it shouldn\\'t be the first thing that pops into someones mind.6. I agree totally with Malec concerning the link between abortion/cancer. I am certainly pro-life and I often ask myself the question; If I were a newly-conceived embryo, which mother would I choose - the pro-lifer, or the pro-choice? Would there be any choice? Consider the fact that every one of the 6 billion plus humans on this planets were once only seconds old - living, breathing, viable and precious human lives, whom someone treated with deep respect and caring, and gave a chance of life. I had a child at the age of 41 - I was alone, divorced - and offered an abortion. I chose life for him and I look at the treasure beside me now and I am filled with awe at the way his life and mine have been so enriched and what seemed impossible all those years ago and too fraught with complications, is a joy and fulfillment in my life way beyond anything I could ever describe. For anyone contemplating abortion, I pray the gift of hope for you and loving support. I know how it feels to be desperate but there is love and there is support out there for you. ',\n",
       " 'Way to go Wake Forest University scientists -- for adding to the body of evidence connecting stress to illness and for reporting before anyone else that the stress hormone epinephrine causes changes in prostate and breast cancer cells that may make them resistant to death.Emotional stress contributes not only to the development of cancer, says lead researcher George Kulik, D.V.M., Ph.D, but it also reduces the effectiveness of cancer treatments.Previous research shows levels of epinephrine, produced by the adrenal glands, are sharply increased during stressful situations and can stay elevated during long-term stress and depression.During this study, published in the on-line Journal of Biological Chemistry, Kulik and colleagues found that a protein called BAD -- the cause of cell death -- becomes inactive when cancer cells are exposed to epinephrine. This is huge for patients and researchers.\"It may be important for patients who have increased responses to stress to learn to manage the effects,\" said Kulik. \"And, the results point to the possibility of developing an intervention to block the effects of epinephrine.\" Comments: 1. Thanks Jacki for posting about this important study.For years leaders in prostate cancer prevention and treatment support have been emphasizing the importance of avoiding stress. For instance, Dr. Charles Myers, MD, a well-known leader in the role of nutrition and physical activity in supporting prevention and treatment, has made minimizing stress one of the cornerstones of an effective program, the others being exercise, diet, and supplements. A key advice on his card \"Tell One Friend How to Prevent Prostate Cancer\" is: \"Incorporate relaxation tehniques into your daily life.\"See this added evidence will reinforce my motivation to avoid stress.I saw your blog shortly after browsing the online abstracts for the national conference of the American Association for Cancer Research, which is just getting underway. I had just searched for \"prostate cancer\", and one of the first of 500 hits involved BAD. I had no idea what that was and bypassed it.

I also think we need to be careful when we post interpretations.Ms. Donaldson stated:Emotional stress contributes not only to the development of cancer, says lead researcher George Kulik, D.V.M., Ph.D, but it also reduces the effectiveness of cancer treatments.However, Mr. Kulik stated:Emotional stress MAY contribute to the development of cancer and MAY also reduce the effectiveness of cancer treatments,\" said George Kulik, D.V.M., Ph.D.The word MAY is huge here. It merely refers to a level of possibility and the link to cancer is mere conjecture.3. In another study, high levels of daily stress appear to result in a LOWER risk of developing breast cancer.<A href=\"http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/high_levels_of_daily_stress_may_result_in_lower_risk_of_breast_cancer_8873\" rel=nofollow>http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/high_levels_of_daily_stress_may_result_in_lower_risk_of_breast_cancer_8873</A>Also,\"The most important finding in this study:<A href=\"http://www.healthandage.com/public/health-center/29/article/1184/Smashing-Myths-about-Breast-Cancer-Part-II.html\" rel=nofollow>http://www.healthandage.com/public/health-center/29/article/1184/Smashing-Myths-about-Breast-Cancer-Part-II.html</A>is what researchers did not find -- they found almost no evidence to support the widely held myth that stress can be a direct cause of breast cancer development or progression.

       " 'I think all the time about how I\\'m treating my body. Just yesterday, while making a tuna sandwich I wondered if I was using too much light mayonnaise. I considered the fact that tuna contains mercury, that I should monitor how much of this product I consume. How much is too much anyway? I worried that my tuna was slathered on white bakery bread, a true diet no-no, and I found solace in only two items -- my hand-picked strawberries and the water I poured in my cup. Wait, the strawberries were pretty plump, ripe, red, and juicy -- an indication they were possibly pumped full of hormones and sprayed with pesticides before I washed and gulped them down.How did I do overall at lunch? I think maybe not so good. I did run 2.5 miles and completed 20 push-ups, a bunch of sit-ups, and few core exercises. Maybe I come out balanced in the end. Maybe not.I think about this sort of stuff every day because of cancer. I\\'ve already had it -- and I don\\'t want it again. So I try to eat right. I exercise. I don\\'t smoke. I don\\'t drink alcohol. But here\\'s my dilemma: I did all this before my cancer diagnosis (with the exception of an occasional drink), and the disease still lived in my body -- maybe for many years before I knew it was there. What should I do differently now when I didn\\'t do all that bad before?Shall I exercise all day long? Eat only the most pure and untainted of foods? Somehow that doesn\\'t seem much like living. So I suppose I\\'ll keep on doing what I do every day -- living in moderation -- with hopes that I\\'ve had my one and only brush with cancer and that the bout I had was caused by something other than how I treat my body. Comments: 1. You didn\\'t mention how long ago you had cancer. Live your life as well as you can, but don\\'t obsess. The guilt is what kills us when we think we could have done better. I have a glass of red wine a few times a week, try to eat a mediterranean diet, but fail at lots of other things, like exercising for long periods at a time. Have fun, pray a lot, and be thankful for each day you\\'re well. It gets better after about 5 or 6 years. Good luck.2. Jacki,Just do what you\\'re doing. Eat healthy, exercise, everything in moderation remember? A person could drive themselves crazy really! What should I eat? How much? And so on and on. Some people might be able to handle this life style of obsessing with their diet to what kind of soap to use. It is obvious to me what a person should stay away from to protect your body and the environment.Having friends who have died of cancer, two of them lived their lives perfectly, from childhood up into their young adult lives, and then cancer took them away. My other friends lived life to the fullest, and the cancer won again. There was a history of cancer in their family. So, you see, it really doesn\\'t matter anymore. I believe cancer is somehow connected to our environment, genetics, who really knows all the answers. Someone has the answer and the cure, whether we see it in our life time, who knows. My feelings now are just to eat healthy, stay away from stress as much as possible, use safe environmental products, smile and be happy, and help those who are in need. Believe in yourself.I can understand your fears totally. But don\\'t let those same fears control you. Easier said than done right? You\\'re doing fine.Thank you, good health to allSincerely Jason3. When it comes down to it, I believe it is mostly genetic with a bit of preservatives, other food additives, pesticides, etc thrown in.

       " 'A new study shows certain genes may make some lung cancer patients more sensitive to chemotherapy. This is a good thing -- increased sensitivity in this case means lower doses of drug therapy work as good or better than higher doses.Researchers looked at more than 21,000 genes in cells common to non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common type of the disease. Of these genes, 87 came up with heightened sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug Taxol. To be exact, the genes were 1,000 times more sensitive when exposed to the drug for 48 hours.Chemotherapy is a very blunt instrument, says one researcher. Locating genes that make chemotherapy drugs more potent at lower doses is a critical step toward tailoring treatment and minimizing side effects for patients.Two other drugs -- Navelbine and Gemzar -- were tested on six of the Taxol-sensitive genes. The genes did not respond to these drugs. Comments: 1. Scientists have conducted a series of pioneering experiments demonstrating a new way of making tumor cells far more susceptible to attack and also the possibility to lower dosage levels to a point where toxic side effects from the drugs are unlikely to occur.Microarrays (gene chips) can examine gene expression in up to 50,000 different genes at once. It\\'s mainly used for screening/gene discovery work. Out of 50,000 genes, maybe 15 or 20 may be involved in determining sensitivity/resistance to a given drug.So you screen 50,000 genes to discover an association and then you focus in on only a few hundred or so for more careful study by some other method (the \"gold standard\" for sensitivity and reproducibility is called real time polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR) to determine sensitivity/resistance.In this latest experiment, scientists screened a total of more than 21,000 genes and found that 87 can influence a tumor cell\\'s sensitivity to chemotherapy.Genes make proteins, the molecules that comprise and maintain all the body\\'s tissues. Genes produce their effect by sending molecules called messenger RNA to the protein-making machinery of a cell. They set the protein-making machinery in motion through this gofer messenger RNA (or mRNA).The technique called RNA interference (RNA-i) allows scientists to \"silence\" certain genes. In RNA interference, certain molecules trigger the destruction of RNA from a particular gene, so that no protein is produced. Thus, the gene is effectively silenced.RNA interference is important for regulating the activity of genes (a fundamental mechanism for controlling the flow of genetic information). RNA interference (or RNAi) is a mechanism that interferes with mRNA, a natural molecular switch, regulating gene expression in plants, animals and humans, by \"silencing\" over-active or malfunctioning genes.Tissue culture methods (Cell Function Analysis) have played a major part in the work of more than a third of the winners of the Nobel prize for medicine since 1953, including RNA interference (the 2006 winner), the nature of oncogenes (1989), growth factors (1986), monoclonal antibodies (1984), tumor viruses (1975), and virus genetics (1965).The ability to transfect (introducing foreign DNA into a cell) cultured cells with DNA gene sequences has allowed us to assign functions to different genes and understand the mechanisms that activate or redress their function. It has made gene therapy and stem cell research possible.<A href=\"http://www.therapeuticsdaily.com/news/article.cfm?contentvalue=1310293&amp;contenttype=sentryarticle&amp;channelID=28\" rel=nofollow>http://www.therapeuticsdaily.com/news/article.cfm?contentvalue=1310293&amp;contenttype=sentryarticle&amp;channelID=28</A>2. I\\'d agree that gene profiling tests, important in order to identify new therapeutic targets and thereby to develop useful drugs, is still years away from working successfully in predicting treatment response for individual patients. Perhaps this is because they are performed on dead, preserved cells that were never actually exposed to the chemotherapy drugs whose activity they are trying to assess. However, it will never, for very practical reasons be as effective as the cell culture method, which exists today and is not hampered by the problems associated with gene expression tests.Cell culture assay measures the net effect of all processes within the cancer, acting with and against each other in real time, and it tests living cells actually exposed to drugs and drug combinations of interest. It is a perfectly appropriate medical service, worthy of coverage on a non-investigational basis. And they abandon the artificial distinction between \"resistance\" testing and \"sensitivity\" testing and are providing coverage for the whole FDA-approved kit.Tens of thousands of individual patient specimens are currently being submitted for testing by more than 1,000 clinical oncologists, surgeons and pathologists annually in the U.S. It is certainly each practitioner\\'s prerogative to order these tests. It seems probable that a self-educated oncologist, genuinely on the cutting-edge would tend to be aggressive in actual treatment beyond mere rhetoric, and make use of running tests on a \"fresh\" tumor specimen before selecting a chemotherapy option.3. Dr Anthea Martin, science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: \"If this \\'gene blocking\\' technique could be used in patients, it may mean that lower doses of paclitaxel could be given, which would still be effective and reduce side effects.\"However, the study has only looked at isolated cancer cells in the laboratory - this is a great first step, but we don\\'t know if the technique will work in tumours. This will take more research, and we look forward to future developments.\" Further research on animals is needed; the first clinical trials on cancer patients can only begin in no fewer than three to five years. Again, taxpayers should not pay for unproven \"petri dish\" tests that, as yet, prove no benefit. Patience is needed as are research dollars.4. Also, a very good way to make the developers of cell culture tests wealthy.At this point in time, there is no evidence that cell culture tests benefit patients. These self-educated oncologists submit with the knowledge that their is no evidence of benefit. And while, in many cases, patients spend thousands on these tests, these very same oncologists tell their patients that we have no idea whether it will help or not.You\\'ll read that there is benefit on perhaps hundreds of blogs by this one AND ONLY individual, yet make no mistake, there is, at this time no evidence at all.A GOOGLE search like this <A href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=rgz&amp;q=cell+culture+tests+pawelski&amp;btnG=Search\" rel=nofollow>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=rgz&amp;q=cell+culture+tests+pawelski&amp;btnG=Search</A>returns hundreds of identical posts by the above individual.I wouldn\\'t call it trolling, but there are thousands of postings just like the above, but only by one, on the internet.The researchers WHO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK IN THE FIELD certainly know the importance of evidence-based medicine. It\\'s stated in the article.We need to take a deep breath here, support the research, and allow the experts to help us take on cancer.5. Good point about how choice of drug selection makes the trialists wealthy. It is a fact that the choice of chemotherapy correlates signficantly with reimbursement to the treating oncologist. (Jacobson, M.,O\\'Malley, A.J., Earle, C.C., et al. Health Affairs 25(2):437-443, 2006).Three decades of prospective, randomized trials have failed to define the most optimum treatment regimens. In this environment, oncologists tend to choose treatments based on the advantage to the oncologist, more so than to the patient.No one has ever suggested the need to perform prospective, randomized trials between treatments chosen in the presence and absence of the profit motive. Perhaps these kinds of trials should be done, because progress in the most important forms of cancer with regard to drug selection has been negligible.What more important progress may occur will likely come from radically new drugs and from biologically individualized drug selection, rather than from countless iterations of empiric trials with the old drugs (like taxanes).Medicare has finally come to realize that selecting treatments on the basis of tumor biology rather than on reimbursement to the treating oncologist is not only good science and good medicine, but good medical economics.While the above poster has you trolling on Google, take a closer look at \"Chemotherapy Drug Concession\" - \"Reimbursements Sway Oncologists\\' Drug Choices\" - \"Drug Selection in Cancer Treatment\"Balance is much needed to the flow of cancer information which is largely controlled by people with their own biases and self interests.6. Fortunately, thousands of postings to hundreds of blogs about cell culture assays by one individual on the entire internet does nothing to make cell culture assays effective as is indicated by the fact that there is not even one study to show effectiveness. Yet individuals, like those at Rational Therapeutics still want you to spend money on their tests. If you do go to their site, you will see not one study, just anecdotes.Only research by scientists in the field will result in the truth.Until then, a cancer patient should not in the least feel guilty about not spending hard-earned money on a completely unproven method of cancer treatment.7. Good review papers exist on cell culture assays and are increasingly appreciated, understood, and applied by private sector and European clinicians and scientists. This literature is not understood by many NCI investigators and by NCI-funded university investigators.NCI studies never determine if \"fresh\" tumor assays worked. All of the considerable literature which supports the use of these assays in patient management has been based on true fresh tumor (non-passaged) cell assays.Some years ago, NCI made an attempt to study \"assay-directed\" therapy of lung cancer. The study was a failure because they used established permanent cell lines (instead of fresh cells) to do the work. The result was a dismal 11% response.The NCI used \"cell lines\" because the major expertise of the investigators who carried out any study was in the creation of cancer cell lines, and they wanted to see if they could perform assays on these cell lines to use in patient therapy. The results were that they were able to test successfully only 22% of specimens received, including only 7% of primary lesions.This contrasts with a 75% overall success rate reported by earlier investigators who used the same assay system in \"fresh\" tumors and a routinely obtained &gt; 95% success rate using improved methods available today.Then there were sophistcated programs to discover gene expression microarrays which predict for responsiveness to drug therapy. However, the limitations and non-applicability of the NCI efforts, failed to realize that the way to identify informative gene expression patterns is to have a \"gold standard\" and the (cell-death) cell culture assays are by far the most powerful, efficient, useful \"gold standard\" to have, adding the potential value of the assays to individualize cancer therapy.Many have hoped that molecular tests would hold the key to success, however, cell culture assays have contributed to the molecular understanding of chemosensitivity and resistance.8. Charlie Rose had his latest installment of his 12-part Science Series, focusing on the importance of scientific research in human health. Episode Four was an in-depth discussion of the latest research in cancer. Always glad to see an authoritative, informational program being sponsored by a huge drug company with billions riding on the behavior patterns of physicians and patients - it ensures that the reporting will be completely free from any sort of bias. Packing the panel with academicians whose entire careers are utterly dependent upon mega-trials funded 100% by the same drug company further reinforces patients\\' confidence that the information conveyed will be balanced and fair.Perhaps they, oncology research fellows and others, see the hand writing is on the wall. In an effort to establish cancer treatment guidelines, even the Community Oncology Alliance\\'s (COA) QSP Committee recommends that CMS broaden acceptable guidelines, and not limit the guidelines for \"individual\" practice use. According to its\\' chair, ASCO has technology assessments that are very limited and updates which are not timely (and as we now know, not \\'open\\' and accurate). NCCN guidelines are fine but many practices use other guidelines or develop evidence based treatment guidelines for their own individual practices or modify guidelines based on evidence which they use as their defined evidence based standards for their practices. The self educated oncologist doesn\\'t \"submit\" to the status-quo. They can think for themselves.9. \"There is so much misinformation about the cell culture assay tests being perpetuated.\"The misinformation is that cell culture assay tests benefit patients. There is no evidence that this is true and until that evidence is available I will continue to say that there is no evidence.You will notice that the above poster will not post links to evidence because there is none. But, he will make cancer patients feel guilty about not spending thousands for the test from these companies.10. There is so much misinformation about the cell culture assay tests being perpetuated. All the important progress in cell culture assays has come outside of NCI-sponsored university-based research and it strikes at the heart of the standard NCI/university clinical research paradigms. That\\'s why many doctors have not yet made the effort to learn about this. Because of the efforts of a dedicated private sector and the availability of media such as the Internet, the NCI and NCI-oriented institutions will soon find themselves in the position of having to make the effort to learn and to be forced to provide sound reasons if they choose not to use these tests in the management of individual patients.Conventionally, what clinical oncologists have been attempting to do is to define the \"best\" treatment to give to the \"average\" patient with a given disease, otherwise known as the lowest common denominator theory of cancer chemotherapy (roll-the-dice). For 30 years they have been attempting to define the best drugs to give to the average patient, with no real progress with regard to identifying better chemotherapy regimens for the average patient. It is a scientifically bankrupt paradigm which has not fostered either efficient or humane progress in cancer chemotherapy. As I said above, balance is much needed to the flow of cancer information which is largely controlled by people with their own biases and self interests.11. Packing the panel with academicians whose ENTIRE careers are UTTERLY DEPENDENT upon MEGA-trials funded 100% by the SAME drug company.Yes. The President of Hopkins, Sloan Kettering and Dana Farber are interviewed. They are evil academicians.I stopped reading after this over-the-top, misleading proclamation. You\\'ve become almost a caricature of yourself.So tell me....what have you done in the laboratory lately?Here\\'s the link (the above poster rarely includes links to \"studies\" mentioned in his posts)for those interested in a very good discussion.Click on episode 4:<A href=\"http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/think/mn_think_cr_science.jsp\" rel=nofollow>http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/think/mn_think_cr_science.jsp</A>12. Psychologists with their own lack of self-esteem makes for strange bedfellows. Perhaps oncology research fellows and others do see the hand-writing on the wall?I know it is not me or that I write about cell culture assays. She criticizes numerous people on this and many other web sites. She can keep the ball! She couldn\\'t handle the proof.She criticizes me for scaring cancer patients, that it makes them feel guilty. Oncologists that scare cancer patients into chemotherapy is what\\'s disingenuous.Cancer treatment does not only involve chemotherapy, very little of it does. There are a multitude of cancer modalities to treat cancer, traditional treatments, experimental therapies, integrative treatment, and alternative therapies.There are Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, Lung Metagene Predictor and others that will spare the 60% to 80% of cancer patients who would unlikely have a recurrence and don\\'t need chemotherapy. For those patients who would be at a higher risk of recurrence (the 20% to 40%), there are cell culture assays to help find what treatments have the best opportunity of being successful (that surely wouldn\\'t make the developers of cell culture tests wealthy).If she thinks there is no clinical data to support cell culture assays, why do you think Medicare would pay for such a test? Medicare contractor, National Heritage Insurance Company, has that data. Proof of improvements in treatment outcomes. Not like Aetna\\'s recent reimbursement policy that requires \"anticipated\" or \"expected\" improvements in treatment outcomes with genetic tests.But this is what you can expect from someone who has no knowledge of cell culture assays. She didn\\'t even go through the material. 13. The extensive slide presentation linked above concludes with THIS STATEMENT from Wiesenthal:\"Clinical trials ARE REQUIRED to ESTABLISH the degree to which the observed IN VITRO drug effects reported in this abstract can be used to engineer treatment outcomes in cancer patients.\"Remember, a variety of studies have reported a correlation between in vitro prediction or response and clinical response. While these studies may have internal validity, they CANNOT answer the question of whether patients given assay-guided therapy or empiric therapy have different outcomes. Wiesenthal, the researcher, and Pawelski, the poster, believe in the potential of cell culture assays yet ONLY Wiesenthal knows we need clinical data and we have none. Thank goodness the scientists in the field know we need data before we want someone to buy into these tests and buy the tests.Again, Mr. Pawelski, and Pawelski ONLY as seen here, <A href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=Xid&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=pawelski+cell+culture+assay&amp;spell=1\" rel=nofollow>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;hs=Xid&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=pawelski+cell+culture+assay&amp;spell=1</A>is touting the benefit of these tests in hundreds of blogs, including this one, with no data to back the claims.Cancer patients should know this.14. Recent findings presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in Orlando, Florida concluded that Functional Profiling (whole cell profiling) with cell culture assays is relevant for the study of both \"conventional\" and \"targeted\" antineoplastic drug agents.Cell Culture Assays with \"cell-death\" endpoints can show disease-specific drug activity, are useful clinical and research tools for \"conventional\" and \"targeted\" drugs, and provide unique information complementary to that provided by \"molecular\" tests. There have been more than 25 peer-reviewed publicatons showing significant correlations between cell-death assay results and patient response and survival.The Whole Cell Profiling technique is a cell-death endpoint assay in which drug effect upon cancer cells is visualized directly. Photomicrographs of actual tumor cells sometime show that the exact same identical individual culture well, shows some clusters have taken up vast amounts of a drug, while right next door, clusters of the same size, same appearance, same everything haven\\'t taken up any of the drug.So it doesn\\'t matter if there is a \"target\" molecule (protein or receptor) in the cell that the targeted drug is going after, if the drug either won\\'t \"get in\" in the first place or if it gets pumped out/extruded or if it gets immediately metabolized inside the cell, drug resistance is multifactorial. The advantage of the Whole Cell Profiling technique is that it can show this in the \"population\" of cells.The Whole Cell Profiling technique makes the statistically significant association between prospectively reported test results and patient survival. It can correlate test results which are obtained in the lab and reported to physicians prior to patient treatment, with significantly longer or shorter overall patient survival depending upon whether the drug was found to be effective or ineffective at killing the patient\\'s tumor cells in the laboratory.This could help solve the problem of knowing which patients can tolerate costly, new treatments and their harmful side-effects. These \"smart\" drugs are a really exciting element of cancer medicine, but do not work for everyone, and a test to determine the efficacy of these drugs in a patient could be the first crucial step in personalizing treatment to the individual.<A href=\"http://www.asco.org/portal/site/ASCO/menuitem.64cfbd0f85cb37b2eda2be0aee37a01d/?vgnextoid=09f8201eb61a7010VgnVCM100000ed730ad1RCRD&amp;vmview=vm_search_results_view&amp;selectedConfs=&amp;SearchFilter=Speaker&amp;SearchTerm=weisenthal\" rel=nofollow>http://www.asco.org/portal/site/ASCO/menuitem.64cfbd0f85cb37b2eda2be0aee37a01d/?vgnextoid=09f8201eb61a7010VgnVCM100000ed730ad1RCRD&amp;vmview=vm_search_results_view&amp;selectedConfs=&amp;SearchFilter=Speaker&amp;SearchTerm=weisenthal</A>Click on \"Slides\" to presentation relating to testing for antitumor and antiangiogenic activity of Iressa, Tarceva, Sutent, Nexavar, and Avastin in primary cultures of fresh human tumors.<A href=\"http://www.medicarenhic.com/cal_prov/articles/chemoassaytest_0107.htm\" rel=nofollow>http://www.medicarenhic.com/cal_prov/articles/chemoassaytest_0107.htm</A><A href=\"http://www.weisenthal.org/medicare_lcd_final.pdf\" rel=nofollow>http://www.weisenthal.org/medicare_lcd_final.pdf</A>15. I\\'ve read this blog off and on recently and am fed up with the constant, wateful personal attacks and arrogance of hchcec. It is patently unfair for them to personally attack anyone else\\'s thoughtful opinions or information which just doesn\\'t meet with the personal opinions of one person, particularly if that one person surely isn\\'t the world\\'s expert on what is/isn\\'t acceptable treatment. Patients today MUST be able to have any and all information and opinions available to them in order to make choices and ask questions of their healthcare providers.16. Mr. Pawelski states that\"Absent the testing, they are free to choose what for them is the most remunerative therapy.\"So, if your oncologist does not choose the testing, he or she ONLY chooses what will make him or her money, according to Pawelski.How does that make you feel today?17. I don\\'t use adhominems,Reader, as you have done.Pawelski presents cell culture assay information on blog after blog as beneficial. This is false, at this time. Wiesenthal, whom he quotes daily, even says there is, as yet , no data that it\\'s beneficial for the patient. I\\'m happy that he offers you information you desire. No problem with that, as long as it\\'s accurate. As he blogs daily on perhaps hundreds of blogs, someone has to start calling him on the data. Research is being done, but there is not one lick of evidence that cell culture assays benefit cancer patients, sir. He says chemotherapy, given in the standard way, is incorrect, and ONLY through cell culture assay testing, is chemotherapy correct.Sorry, but this isn\\'t true, and that\\'s why it has, as of March, been stated that\"The enthusiasm for chemosensitivity assays, in general, has diminished over the years, due to the poor positive predictive values.\"<A href=\"http://www.regence.com/trgmedpol/lab/lab06.html\" rel=nofollow>http://www.regence.com/trgmedpol/lab/lab06.html</A>There\\'s no need to get mad at me. I am not silencing Pawelski. I am merely calling him on his misstatements of benefit.Hopefully, cancer patients, frightened into thinking that their oncologists do not have their best interests in mind, they only care about money, they\\'re undereducated, the heads of Hopkins, Dana Farber, and Sloan Kettering (who\\'s \"entire careers are utterly dependent upon mega-trials funded 100% by the same drug company\"), are drug co. shills, will hear another opinion.I mean, sir, isn\\'t it frightening enough to have a diagnosis of cancer, at at the same time, read on this blog that that there is a scandal out there, one that results in your early demise?Sorry, I don\\'t buy the conspiracy theories.I like facts.18. What she (HCHCEC) fails to tell you is none of the available laboratory tests used in the selection of treatments for cancer patients have ever been tested for EFFICACY. This includes estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, Her2/neu, immunohistochemical staining for tumor classification, bacterial culture and sensitivity testing, CT, MRI and Pet Scans to measure tumor response to treatment, as opposed to merely ACCURATE, before they are used in clinical decisons regarding treatment selection.The precedent of tests such as estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, Her2/neu, BCR-ABL, C-KIT, CD-20, etc., and panels of immunohistochemical stains for subclassifying tumor, all used to select chemotherapy, do so in precisely the same manner as a cell culture assay is used. There are medical tests, such as serial CT, MRI, and/or PET scans, performed for the purpose of monitoring the size of the tumor to determine if it is shrinking or growing with chemotherapy. The purpose of this testing is to determine if chemotherapy with specific drugs should be continued or changed to different drugs. Thus, these radiographic tests are also used as an aid in making clinical decisions about the choice of chemotherapy.What Weisenthal is saying is that he is willing to break that unyielding mold and test his cell culture assay for EFFICACY, as they do for drug approval. Remember, Taxol was approved by the FDA in 1992 with only 30% EFFICACY. Knowing that upfront, many cancer patients would not take the drug (particularly when there are so many other drugs). In fact, the NCI \"state of the art\" web sites tells us no data support the superiority of any particular regimen. So it would appear that published reports of clinical trials provide precious little in the way of guidance.Look at what criteria are being applied to evaluate emerging forms of testing, such as molecular-based testing used to select drugs such as gefitinib, erlotinib, bevacizumab, etc. As well as tests such as the Oncotype DX test, used to make chemotherapy decisions in breast cancer. Look at what criteria have been applied by regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, in the approval of cancer chemotherapy sensitivity test kits. What is found is that the criteria applied has been ACCURACY and what has never been applied is EFFICACY. And yet the ASCO working group review (Schrag, D. et al. J Clin ONcol 22:3631, 2004) specifically EXCLUDED from consideration all papers and data dealing with test ACCURACY and considered only papers addessing the issue of test EFFICACY.Why is information lacking regarding the EFFICACY of virtually all medical tests? It\\'s simply that medical treatments (e.g. drugs, devices) are hugely profitable commodities, which justify the huge costs of prospective, randomized clinical trials (the ones that those on the Charlie Rose panel whose entire careers are utterly dependent upon funded 100% by big-pharmaca). Medical tests provide vastly less profit. In the case of Cell Culture Assay Tests, the technologies are all non-proprietary, public domain. How many prospective, randomized trials are carried out to test one generic drug against another? The only such studies performed are rare, government-sponsored trials.The cost of performing a Cell Culture Assay Test is truly insignificant compared to the costs associated with infusion chemotherapy. In the absence of the assays, oncologists will base their drug selections on reimbursement more than on any other single factor. Those oncologists who order the assay do so at their own personal financial disadvantage. Absent the testing, they are free to choose what for them is the most remunerative therapy. When they order the tests, they do so either because they themselves want to choose the treatment which is most likely to work or that this is what their patients want.Either way, they are forced to consider information going beyond reimbursement. The worst case scenario, cost-wise, is that the treatment chosen with the benefit of cell culture assay information will be the same, expensive treatment that they\\'d otherwise choose on the basis of reimbursement. In a better case scenario, treatment based on cell culture assay information will be more efficacious therapeutically; although it may not be the most remunerative to the oncologist, it will benefit the patient, be less expensive, and save money for the health care system.19. adhominem: 1 : appealing to feelings or prejudices rather than intellect 2 : marked by an attack on an opponent\\'s character rather than by an answer to the contentions madeYour word, not mine.

Oops!This is my last post, as I will not help feed your obsessive need to spend all your time trashing the ideas of others. I can still read and appreciate the rational input from others, with various opinions on the issue, and ignore the space wasted trying to keep attention on yourself.20. I can split hairs as much as hchcec can.ASCO Recommendations on Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Stage II Colon Cancer (JCO Vol 22; No. 16; Aug. 15, 2004)Direct evidence from randomized controlled trials does not support the routine use of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II colon cancer. Patients and oncologists who accept the relative benefit in stage III disease as adequate indirect evidence of benefit for stage II disease are justified in considering the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, particularly for those patients with high-risk stage II disease. The ultimate clinical decision should be based on discussions with the patient about the nature of the evidence supporting treatment, the anticipated morbidity of treatment, the presence of high-risk prognostic features on individual prognosis, and patient preferences. Patients with stage II disease should be encouraged to participate in randomized trials.The ASCO study showed no evidence of benefits for (empirically-selected) adjuvant chemotherapy in Stage II colon cancer, but even in the face of a negative study, said it was OK for individual oncologists and patients to make the decision whether or not they want to be treated.And Deborah Schrag, the second author on the ASCO study that showed no evidence of benefit for (empirically-selected) adjuvant chemotherapy in Stage II colon cancer, but even in the face of a negative study, said that it was OK for individual oncologists and patients to make the decision whether or not they want to be treated. She wouldn\\'t tell her colleagues not to give chemotherapy if they really wanted to. And she\\'s talking about a treatment; not just about a test. The question gets asked in randomized studies. She d',\n",
       " 'es a big meta-analysis and still gets a negative result. But still says, well, OK, you can use it if/when you really want to, if it\\'s OK with your patient. EFFICACY has been tested and refuted, but it\\'s still OK to use treatment which has been proven to be non-efficacious.ASCO points out, because the number of available chemotherapeutic agents has increased enormously over the past few years, the emphasis on the rationale for cell culture assays has never been stronger. But institutions that make a living predominately from clinical trials, no wonder ASCO has not supported the use of cell culture assays outside the clinical trial. Don\\'t want to disturb the income flow (academic center-based oncologists deriving personal profit from the implementation of clinical trials). The same people who maintain that assay-directed therapy should not be used until \"proven\" in prospective randomized clinical trials are the same people who control the clinical trials system, the grant review study sections, and the journal editorial boards.Cowards don\\'t have the guts to leave their names when they insult you. I am a passionately informed writer, sharing knowledgeable information about cancer medicine. I would suggest hchcec actually do some research on Cell Function Analysis before she sets off on groupie tangents.

       " 'Cancer drug Gleevec, used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), has been pulled out of another round of testing so it can get to work stopping the return of a rare stomach cancer. It\\'s that good, according to findings announced on Thursday.The promise of Gleevec should make it standard treatment for people with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), a stomach and intestine cancer diagnosed in 5,000 to 6,000 Americans each year.

       " \"I found Sark long ago -- about 10 years ago when I was working with college students on a campus in Virginia. Part of my job was supervising Resident Assistants -- students who live and work on the residence hall floors and are responsible for building community among residents -- advising them and counseling them and mentoring them and stepping in when conflict and trouble arises. It's a tough job -- being a peer and being in charge at the same time -- and Resident Assistants receive intensive training on how to best manage a floor of students possibly living away from home for the first time. I got to train these student leaders at times -- and Sark's books helped me motivate, inspire, and get to know these individuals. And over the years, as I assumed other jobs and roles and purposes, I found that Sark was still a great companion for me. And now I realize that what Sark has to offer really applies to anyone looking for a little inspiration, a little direction, a little creativity, a little delight. Sark is an author and writer -- a self-proclaimed free spirit whose own imagination and dreams for a better life have been transformed into a series of books and journals and calendars and greeting cards and more. I sent her most recent book -- Sark's New Creative Companion -- to my friend who recently suffered a miscarriage. And I consulted her Journal and Playbook throughout my breast cancer struggles. I've learned a lot from Sark. And here are seven of my favorite morsels.Yes. Sark recommends making little signs that say yes and posting them all over your house. She believes yes is contagious on a subliminal level -- and it affects everything you do.Find inspiring people. They are like vitamins for the soul, Sark writes. So think about who inspires you, find people who inspire you, and surround yourself with people who inspire you. Collect quotes. Sark lets others speak to her and energize her. One of her favorite quotes is, I am here to live out loud (Emile Zola). My favorite quotes are Be patient. Miracles happen every day. And Be kind. Everyone is fighting a battle. Take naps. I wish I had more time -- I wish I made more time -- for naps. There is nothing better than a peaceful retreat -- an escape that is quiet and soothing and still and allows for a return to the motion of the day with a renewed spirit.Recognize your fears. Make a list of your fears. Think of everything -- and write it all down. Sark writes that she was once afraid of so many things that she filled twelve pages. She suggests acknowledging your fears, inviting them in, entertaining them, and sending them home.Don't forget who loves you. Don't forget who supports you. Although we may know we are loved and supported, it is helpful during times of distress or despair -- and plain old happy times too -- to actually list the names of these people. So draw a big circle on a piece of paper and list the names of your loved ones inside the circle. Then draw a simple sketch of a tree with branches -- you don't need to be an artist or to even recognize your drawing as a tree -- and list on the branches the names of everyone who supports you. The purpose of this activity -- to see how love bubbles over and to admire your support system.Live Juicy. This is my favorite morsel for the soul. Sark writes, I think it's possible to forget how alive we really are. We can become dry and tired, just existing instead of really living. We need to remind ourselves of the juice of life and make that a habit. Find those places inside that jump for joy and do things that bring our your best, most magic self. Keep doing them.

       " \"Ever wonder what fish to eat, what fish to avoid, what fish is healthy, what fish is cancer-causing? I do. I'm looking into this whole fish thing. And while my search for information is in no way exhaustive and my findings are far from conclusive, I have found some interesting fishy facts and figures.Think about this:Fish definitely has health benefits. It's low in fat, high in protein, and rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Americans love this. How do I know? Because on average, each of us eats a record 16.6 pounds of fish every year. Our intake of shrimp and salmon has doubled, in fact, since 1994.Fish definitely has its drawbacks too. Headlines repeatedly warn us of dangerous contaminants in lakes, rivers, and oceans. Don't forget about mercury, the biggest fish health hazard. It's been linked to neurological problems in developing fetuses and children, making consumption of shark, swordfish, tilefish (aka golden snapper or golden bass), king mackeral, canned albacore tuna, and tuna steaks a no-no for hoards of women and children.For just about everyone else, the benefits of eating moderate amounts of seafood greatly outweigh the risks. Just watch out for those PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) -- possible carcinogenic chemical compounds that end up in some seafood. To avoid PCBs, steer clear of farmed salmon which contains high levels of these compounds or limit your intake to less than one single eight-ounce meal per month. Opt for the wild variety of salmon to avoid this concern altogether. Or take the side of the FDA. Their reports say salmon is a powerhouse when it comes to protecting heart and developing cancer from this source is much lower than the risk of heart disease.Source: Good Housekeeping, April 2007 Comments: \",\n",

His positive and healthy perspective on losing his mom will surely keep him company.I got to see Steve and Kim -- my very best friend whose bouncy ringlets I envied long before I got my own post-chemotherapy curls -- on the same day Steve\\'s mom died. They needed to get away and wanted a distraction for their two small children.I am honored to have been chosen as my friends\\' destination -- not only so they could begin to heal from their loss, but because I gained a renewed sense of calm about death and dying during the time we talked and laughed and reminisced.Steve\\'s mom, 69, died at home in the loving arms of hospice caretakers who offered her round-the-clock care. During her final hours, she received a bath, a back rub, and a massage with body lotion. She sent non-verbal messages to her family members indicating she wished to be alone and once she had convinced everyone to head for bed, she took her final breaths. She died facing a wall, in contrast to her usual position in which she faced the door, as if to welcome all visitors. Her final resting pose was perhaps her way of saying good-bye. Steve sees it this way.Just moments after Steve\\'s mom was driven away in a funeral home car, Steve saw the clouds part. And then the rain fell. \"Mom just figured out how to turn on the water,\" Steve said. I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever forget this remark. Or the fact that the rain didn\\'t last for very long on Sunday. The day Steve\\'s mom died was gorgeous, glorious, and sunny.There\\'s so much more we talked about -- like the convertible Steve\\'s mom drove and how he thought about placing her urn, her photo, and a scarf in the seat and taking his mom for one last spin before turning the car in -- and we passed the day in a celebratory manner.

       " \"When my babies were born, those who promote breastfeeding as the only effective method for nourishing a child and preventing illness urged and pushed and prodded me to embrace their beliefs. I did believe them, never doubted them, and sometimes felt guilty I wasn't able to nurse my children -- a previous breast reduction surgery disabled my milk flow.I got over it. Bottles and formula worked well for my family, allowed my husband to share middle-of-the-night feeding duties, and grew my two little boys into sturdy, healthy beings. What I haven't completely gotten over is that breastfeeding could have done a whole lot of good for me too. It could have prevented the breast cancer I developed just after my second child stopped drinking formula from his bottle.Research indicates breastfeeding can decrease the risk of breast cancer for women who have their first baby after age 25. I was 31 when my first child was born.Previous studies showed that having a first baby before the age of 25 or having no children protected against breast cancers fueled by hormones. It did not, however, stop the less common, harder-to-treat tumors not fueled by hormones, like mine. It seems even breastfeeding would not have prevented my cancer. That was then. This is now.New studies show women who give birth after age 25 are twice as likely to develop either type of breast cancer. Therefore, breastfeeding really protects all women bearing children after 25 from both forms of the disease. It turns out breastfeeding could have helped me. But I couldn't do it. So it didn't.What's done is done. I'll get over it. And I may just become one of those women who urge and push and prod others to embrace the benefits of breastfeeding. Comments: 1. Great blog. There are many good reasons to breastfeed. If it prevents cancer, that another benefit. But, I don't see a real problem with interspersing breastfeeding with some formula to give Mom a break every now then.Bigger Question, though: In the latest issue of Scientific American, there's a fascinating article by Dr. Peter Duesberg, who asserts that the triggering mechanism of cancer, isn't a gene mutation, but rather a derangement at the chromosome level.See Scientific AmericanI'd love to hear your take on whether aneuploid is the actual cause of cancer.2. Jacki, I had the same kind of cancer you didâ\\x80\\x94 and I breastfed onechild for 5 months and the other for 3 YEARS. So don't beat yourselfup about not breastfeeding. It might have helped them, but it suredidn't help me! Mia3. Wow. I think you are very brave to examine this whole subject. A very dear friend of mine died of breast cancer last year and she was given bottles of formula at the hosptial for her babies, and bad advice by her doctors that it didn't matter. I know that not every case of breast cancer could be prevented by breastfeeding, that's the problem with applying epidemiology to individual cases. Not everyone who smokes gets lung cancer and some non-smokers do get lung cancer. But I will always wonder if my friend would be alive today if she hadn't given her babies formula, if she would have been that one woman who wouldn't have got it, well, I can't tell you what that would mean for us. Thank you for writing this. God bless. 4. I had my first baby at the age of 38 and breastfed exclusively. I still got breast cancer and am Her2 positive. I've read exhaustively on cancer trying to find answers, but it is still a huge mystery. This is why I really celebrate the definitive successes, such as Herceptin. But even that poses the question: why would it work on Most but not All?5. I breastfed both my girls, the first for about two months and the second til she was 3 yrs.old.I still got breast cancer. How? Why? Sometimes I think these studies are being done just to make us do it ,so, they can study it in that certain approach. Sorry I am newly diagnosed and still very upset,but, I do know that breastfeeding my children was not a mistake.6. Great advice with lot of supporting data through continued studies. Thanks for posting this Jacki !!!!7. Nobody knows what causes breast cancer. All these types of studies do is fuel the guilt that many of us women feel when we are diagnosed. What did I do wrong? That's the first question many ask, and so many of us fall into the trap of pointing to choices made earlier in life as somehow causing our disease. Breast cancer is not self-inflicted. Don't beat yourself up. Think to your future and what you need to get through treatment and to stay healthy. \",\n",

I have had for the past five a half years the glorious freedom to stay at home with my children -- and the freedom, thanks to my husband who works to support us all, to avoid an all-encompassing and potentially stressful career. And recently, I have been enjoying two new freedoms -- one thanks to my three-year-old son who decided that he could in fact use the potty which has afforded me the thrilling freedom from changing diapers, smelling diapers, buying diapers, storing diapers, carrying diapers. He is my youngest child and his major feat has truly set me free from a way of life that has lingered on and on. But even more liberating than this -- which still is huge in my book -- is my new freedom from an almost-two-year journey through cancer treatment. My last infusion of cancer-fighting drugs sailed through my veins last week and I am now free to live my days without constant medical intervention. It's a freedom not all cancer patients get. A freedom I have never known. A freedom I will not take for granted, will not ever forget, will not ever stop enjoying.

In early experiments, the vaccine held off or stopped the growth of tumors in all of the mice studied. Some mice were even cured.Think about this:Research presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research reveals this vaccine is different from most under development that help kick-start the immune systems of sick patients. In this case, the vaccine tells the immune system to recognize breast cancer cells and to attack and kill them on the spot.One researcher says breast cancer cells usually fly under the radar of the immune system. To combat this problem, the injectable vaccine uses a bacteria-type substance that is altered to contain the gene HER2/neu and also antibodies that rev up the immune system. This makes the body react and wipe out cells containing HER2/neu.If continued studies prove promising, the vaccine would work for the 15 to 25 percent of women whose breast cancers overexpress HER2/neu.

       " \"It's called triple-negative breast cancer and it manifests itself in the lack of expression of two cell surface proteins -- estrogen and progesterone receptors -- and also the protein HER2. It's a disease that does not typically respond to treatment with standard chemotherapy drugs and therefore, diagnosis can come with a poor prognosis. But a new study out of Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston indicates this type of disease is sensitive to the drug cisplatin. The study, appearing online in the April 19 Journal of Clinical Investigation and in the journal's May print issue, shows that triple-negative breast cancer expresses larger amounts of two proteins, delta-Np63 and TAp73. Delta-Np63 binds to TAp73 and prevents it from killing cancerous cells. Cisplatin does the trick, though, and releases TAp73 from delta-Np63. This causes the cells to die and offers hope for a sometimes hopeless disease.

And so I am in the process of weaning. For two weeks, I will take one pill every other day instead of every day. Then for two weeks, I will take one pill and take two days off, then one pill and three days off and so on, until I am no longer taking anything. I worry some about heading straight back to a state of depression once the medication is out of my system. But mostly, I worry about staying on the medication, about relying on something I may no longer need. So the time is right. Here are seven reasons why:   Cancer is behind me -- more than two years behind me. I am surviving. I   have no reason to weep anymore.   I have gathered handfuls of coping skills related to stress, anxiety, and   fear. I am so much better equipped to handle my problems now.   I want to accomplish life on my own, without the aid of a drug.   I want to let go of the burden of taking a pill every day.   All medications have side effects. I don't want any of them.   All medications come with a financial burden. I don't want that either.     I want to feel like I have arrived, like I have traveled through a dark   tunnel and have popped out at the other end, all in one healthy piece. I can't   do this until I am standing on my own two feet, free of cancer's lingering   grip.  Comments: \",\n",

There is no guarantee that the cancer will not return. Early detection is our best hope. Eating healthy, exercising, positive thinking is helpful in healing our body from the toxins of chemotherapy. Neuropathy should disappear with time. Remember all those months of chemo that killed the bad and the good cells will need time to cleanse out of the body. I take it you are the one that is the caregiver and the caregiver should take time out for some R &amp; R.

       " 'Strange things have happened to my skin ever since I encountered surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation for breast cancer. I developed an allergic reaction to the Tegaderm tape and latex used during and after my lumpectomy. My entire chest and one underarm were covered in red, itchy, burning, blistery bumps that oozed and then dried up. It took weeks of misery and a bunch of creams, lotions, and drugs to calm my skin and my anxiety too. Then I became allergic to an antibiotic while I was hospitalized for chemo-induced fever and low blood counts. The same horrible skin reaction again covered my chest and this time, my back also. It happened again a few months ago after a trip to the beach and I can only imagine that it was some combination of salt water, sunscreen, and chlorine that prompted this attack. I am still not sure of the cause. But it struck once again recently after a trip to my neighborhood pool. Sunscreen and chlorine were again my possible enemies. So I am staying away from all possible culprits now -- the tape, latex, certain antibiotics, sunscreen, salt water, and chlorine. And of course, the sun too. Perhaps treatment has made my skin even more sensitive than it already was. Perhaps something else is at fault. Regardless, I am now ultra careful about anything I put on my skin. I avoid most everything -- except for Dove soap and sometimes some fruity smelling lotion for my legs -- and I look for anything that is targeted for delicate skin. So an advertisement in a magazine caught my eye today -- an ad for a hypo-allergenic deodorant that is highly recommended by dermatologists and oncologists. Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Spray Mist and Roll On are both extremely gentle and also very effective. They are 100 percent natural and are fragrance free. They last for up to 24 hours, do not stain, and are good for one year. Like some deodorants that merely mask odor, these actually kill the bacteria that causes odor. Naturally Fresh Deodorant seems like a great find to me -- and it can be found CVS, Target, GNC, Hannaford Bros., A&amp;P, Harmon Stores, Drug Fair, and Kerr Drug in the United States and Shoppers Drug Mart, Jean Coutu, and GNC in Canada.

       " \"I never thought I'd hear this one -- that women whose tonsils were removed during childhood may be at increased risk of developing pre-menopausal breast cancer. But sure enough, that's what researchers at the University of Buffalo are reporting.Think about this:Researchers say the association between tonsillectomies and breast cancer may be related to the loss of protective function when tonsils are removed. Also, tonsils can be markers for infection in childhood. Some infections cause inflammation which can contribute to cancer. When the tonsils are gone, markers are gone.Other studies have linked tonsillectomies with an increased risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, and breast and prostate cancers. This study, reported at the 100th annual meeting of the American Association of Cancer Research, confirms the breast cancer connection -- but further study is still necessary. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"A new study of mice implanted with human breast cancer cells shows the spread of the disease to the lungs -- a common metastasis site -- is caused by the abnormal activation of four specific genes working together.The study, published in the journal Nature, indicates that shutting off the genes one by one can slow the growth and spread of this cancer. But turning off all four at one time almost completely stops the process. In mice anyway.These genes are no strangers to researchers who have known for some time about their existence and functions. They just know more about them now.The four genes work together at every step of the metastatic process to allow a breast tumor to develop blood vessels, let tumor cells enter the vessel walls and lungs, and permit them to pass out of the lung vessels and resume growth. New analysis shows that blocking these genes significantly reduces the tangle of blood vessels, making it harder for cancer cells to escape.Researchers, who say the four genes are among 18 they associate with breast cancer metastasis, report that one implication of this study is clear: combined use of drug therapy may be more effective at inhibiting the activity of multiple gene targets. Comments: 1. While it may be very important to zero in on different genes and proteins, when actually taking these drugs, do the drugs even enter the cancer cell? Once entered, does it immediately get metabolized or pumped out, or does it accumulate? In some cases, these and other drugs, kill tumor cells without killing microvascular cells in the same time frame. In other cases they kill microvascular cells without killing tumor cells. In yet other cases they kill both type of cells or neither type of cells. The ability of these agents to kill tumor and/or microvascular cells in the same tumor specimen is highly variable among the different agents.There are assays that allow for the study of anti-microvascular drug effects of standard and targeted agents. They are based upon the principle that microvascular (endothelial and associated) cells are present in tumor cell microclusters obtained from solid tumor specimens. The assay which has a morphological endpoint, allows for visualization of both tumor and microvascular cells and direct assessment of both anti-tumor and anti-microvascular drug effect.Direct visualization of the cancer cells at endpoint allows for accurate assessment of drug activity, discriminates tumor from non-tumor cells, and provides a permanent archival record to improve quality, serve as control and assess dose response in vitro. Photomicrographs show that sometimes clones of tumor cells don't accumulate a drug or combination of drugs. These cells won't get killed by it. The assay can measure the net effect of everything which goes on. Are the cells ultimately killed, or aren't they? Each of the new targeted drugs will not work for everybody. It would be nice to know if they will work for your particular cancer.Source: Cell Function Analysis\",\n",

       " 'Those venturing into space face a very serious occupational hazard -- cancer. The disease can be caused by radiation from the cosmic rays and solar flares astronauts encounter when they travel beyond the Earth\\'s protective magnetic layer or magnetosphere.British scientists are working on rectifying this problem by creating a Star Trek-style deflector shield to protect astronauts from radiation.Think about this:Scientists wish to mimic the magnetic field that protects the Earth with shields deployed around spacecraft and on the surfaces of planets to deflect harmful energetic particles. Details, presented at the Royal Astronomical Society\\'s National Astronomy Meeting in Preston, UK, include the following:   The idea has been linked to the deflector shields that protect the USS   Enterprise and other spacecraft on Star Trek. The shields, like on the TV   show, could be switched on and off.   In order to make the shield, scientists must generate a magnetic field   and then fill it with ionized gas, or plasma. As energetic particles interact   with the plasma, energy is sapped away from them, causing them to slow   down.   Protective shelters would not work on long-duration space journeys due   to the drip of energized particles, thought to be as harmful as large solar   storms. \"The nice thing is that magnet technology is really quite evolved here on Earth,\" says Dr. Mike Hapgood, from the Didcot-based research centre.

       " 'Movie critic Roger Ebert expects to be back to work at his annual festival for overlooked movies this week. It will be his first public appearance since having cancer surgery last summer -- and while some say his appearance may attract the gossip papers, Ebert says, \"So what?\"Ebert, 64, will be seen at the ninth annual Overlooked Film Festival, beginning today at the University of Urbana-Champaign, wearing a gauze bandage around his neck. And his mouth will be seen to droop, he says.This is all because of Ebert\\'s tracheostomy -- it opens an airway through an incision in his windpipe, rendering him speechless -- that resulted from his June 16 surgery to remove a cancerous growth on his salivary gland and a subsequent July 1 surgery to repair a burst blood vessel close to the same site.On Tuesday, Ebert shared that his cancer began in his salivary gland but then spread to his lower right jaw. As a result, part of his mandible was removed and two surgeries were necessary to reconstruct the area. Both surgeries were unsuccessful, however, and led to unanticipated bleeding. \"The doctors now plan an approach that does not involve the risk of unplanned bleeding,\" Ebert, a film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times since 1967, says. \"If all goes well, my speech will be restored.\" This cancer survivor, who says we spend too much time hiding illness and is proud to be back in the spotlight, has also co-hosted the Ebert &amp; Roeper television show with fellow Sun-Times columnist Richard Roeper since 2000. Film critics and filmmakers have been filling in for Ebert during his recovery.

I think this will help a bit with diminishing the stigma of illness and how it effects our appearance.I have had cancer for nearl 10 years, but it is my current treatment that has changed my appearance. I am conflicted about my appearance. My nails were blackened then broke off. I use to tape them to hide it, but that took so much effect that I just let it show, lucky I was never a manicure fanatic or manicure person period. I hearly lost all my hair, Ihave just enough to stick out of a hat and appear as though a few wisps escaped. I am Chinese, so I have that flat back skull that does not wear bald well, I look like a monk or yoda. My skin is so dry, I have to ceremonially moisturize. That dryness has aged my skin, I use to have beautiful skin, that I never appreciated, but now think back to all the compliments I took for granted. And one of my eyes, droops a bit. My goodness, I have suddently changed so much. Okay, enough of that, my point is, when our look changes for less than the better we self-stigmatize ourselves and isolate ourselves, at a time when we need to live to the fullest. Of course, this is not without the merits of other people. I now notice, you don\\'t see many people whose look is less than \"normal\", oh yes, on the bus in wheel chairs, perhaps in the park or some stores, I mean at concerts, nice restaurants, upscale events, etc. Roger Ebert is so courageous and I thank him !I hope this wil help people who look different, come out of the closet ! I know it will help me. 2. Hello Roger from B.C., Canada! I am a long-time fan of your television show although like all independent thinkers, I don\\'t always agree with your opinions. I am,however, an absolute admirer of your courage and indomitable spirit throughout your cancer ordeal.I send you two big thumbs -in -the air for Recovery &amp; Return.Sincerely, RoseMarie Claydon3. Roger Ebert has been an inspiration and role model to me since the first time my mom let me loose in our main branch library and I found one of his criticism anthologies. Since then I have aspired to little else besides being a well spoken and well informed viewer and critic (all other life goals and accomplishments can and do grow from that).I am so thrilled to hear he is recovering and active. I am always glad to see a new piece by him in his e-mail newsletter and hope they continue to increase in frequency. I wish him all the best and, both selfishly and charitably, hope we have him around for a very long time to come.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve always heard the use of herbs and supplements and alternative therapies can be a potentially dangerous pursuit when combined with cancer treatment. But this may not be entirely true.Think about this:Using Chinese herbs alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy may help protect a breast cancer patient\\'s bone marrow and immune system. It may also improve the overall quality of life for women, say researchers at the Chinese Cochrane Centre in Chengdu, China. It is well known that women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer experience significant short term side effects such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, inflammation of the gut lining, decreased numbers of red and white blood cells, and decreased numbers of blood platelets. Those is search of some relief may wish to give Chinese medicinal herbs a try.Researchers say there is conventional evidence indicating that these medicines are safe and effective. Still, \"further trials are needed before the effects of traditional Chinese medicines for people with breast cancer can be evaluated with any real confidence,\" says one professor involved in this area of study. Comments: 1. â\\x80\\x9cThe policy at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center is to advise patients against using any herbs or other supplement -- even vitamins -- during, and for a few weeks before chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\"\"Only two of the studies included important information on how patients were randomized, and NONE included information on patient follow-up or withdrawals.â\\x80\\x9cThese studies failed to provide crucial details on every single important methodological criterion.\"<A href=\"http://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/news/20070418/herbs-may-cut-cancer-treatment-effects\" rel=nofollow>http://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/news/20070418/herbs-may-cut-cancer-treatment-effects</A>2. According to a study recently published in the Annals of Oncology, treatment with Chinese herbal medicine may significantly reduce nausea associated with chemotherapy. Researchers from Hong Kong, China, and the University of Birmingham in England conducted a clinical study to evaluate the potential effects of Chinese herbal medicine among patients with early-stage breast or colon cancer who were treated with chemotherapy. Patient outcomes were evaluated according to NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.Boosting the drug sensitivity of tumor cells might make it possible to give lower doses of a chemotherapy agent while still achieving an effective response and minimizing side effects. Specifically enhancing the sensitivity of cancer cells to killing by chemotherapy drugs has been a focal point of a number of research scientists.There have been occasions when an ovarian cancer patient would go to a Chinese herbalist for treatment with some Chinese herbal medicines. They would have a mushy, mixed response, some softening of the tumors, with progression intra-abdominally. Later biopsied masses were found to be quite sensitive to some of the very drugs that were unsuccessful in the first place. Refractory ovarian cancers are generally very refractory. A short time later, complete response. No tumor left in a patient who\\'d previously had a massive tumor burden and no good prior reponse to anything. Now, the herbal medicine probably didn\\'t do all that much by itself, but what it seemed to do was to chemosensitize the tumor.While some believe that benefits may seem questionable, the herbal concoctions don\\'t appear to do harm.<A href=\"http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/\" rel=nofollow>http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/</A><A href=\"http://www.medpagetoday.com/HematologyOncology/Chemotherapy/tb1/5467\" rel=nofollow>http://www.medpagetoday.com/HematologyOncology/Chemotherapy/tb1/5467</A><A href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/connected/2007/04/19/nhealth119.xml\" rel=nofollow>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/connected/2007/04/19/nhealth119.xml</A>',\n",
       " \"Back in the news: the link between hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and breast cancer. This time, the connection is seemingly more conclusive than before, when some argued that many factors influence the risk of breast cancer, that HRT could not do the job all on its own.Now, two separate studies offer up powerful evidence that HRT is linked to tumor growth. Case in point: when use of the therapy drops, so do incidences of breast cancer.New figures in the New England Journal of Medicine suggest there have been 16,000 fewer cases of breast cancer nationwide since mid-2002, when women stopped taking their hormone pills following the federal Women's Health Initiative announcement connecting the therapy with increased risk of breast cancer, stroke, and heart attack.Many did not want to believe HRT was to blame for so many breast cancer diagnoses. And maybe it's not the actual cause of the disease, but the fuel for tumors trying to grow. These new findings do not appear to be a statistical fluke, says one doctor. Numbers have been computed and re-computed, and the message is clear: HRT is strongly implicated as the guilty party. There is just no other culprit, says a statistician at the National Cancer Institute.Wyeth, maker of Premarin and Prempro -- two forms of hormone therapy -- continues to caution women against drawing any conclusions about HRT and breast cancer.

       " \"The American Cancer Society (ACS) of Ohio has filed a lawsuit challenging the state's workplace smoking ban. The ban exempts some military veterans' halls and other private clubs -- and the ASC says this is not OK. The exemption waters down the law and exposes people to secondhand smoke, say ACS spokeswoman Wendy Simpkins.The smoking ban was approved by 58 percent of voters in November, took effect in December, and will result in fining beginning the first week in May. The law prohibits smoking in most public places, such as restaurants, bars, and office and excludes tobacco shops, designated hotel rooms, and enclosed areas of nursing homes. Halls and clubs can be excluded from the law only if there are no employees.Jay Carey, spokesman for the state Health Department, says public health officials have the authority to set rules for enforcement. They ultimately decided that VFW halls and other private clubs were exempt if they had only members as employees. For the exemption to apply, such clubs also must be nonprofit and in a freestanding building. No nonmembers or children under age 18 can be present.The ACS argues that the state rules are confusing and make the law unworkable.

For one man, whose life did depend on money, it could have been everything. But it wasn't.Think about this:Wayne Schenk won $1 million in the New York lottery on January 12 after purchasing a $5 scratch-off ticket. His jackpot win came just five weeks after his diagnosis of inoperable lung cancer was delivered. His one wish: to receive a lump sum so he could receive specialized treatment for his advanced disease.Lottery officials claim they were sympathetic but just couldn't give him a lump sum. The best they could do was issue him $50,000 annual installments for 20 years. Schenk, 51, only survived for a little more than one year. He died on April 23 at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Syracuse. At the time of his death, he had received just $34,000.So money isn't everything. But could it have been? Comments: \",\n",

She has been fighting the disease and it\\'s cruel spread for many years and finds herself living with constant treatment. Her most recent blog entry, posted on April 14, reads: Feeling down, I just can\\'t shake this tired feeling, cancer treatments may keep you alive but they totally change everything about you. I know I should be grateful but I miss the way I used to be. I miss my hair ... I miss my eyebrows ... I miss my eyelashes ... I miss my toenails ... I miss my slender body ... I miss my energy ... I miss shopping for hours ... I miss not being afraid ... I miss not taking medication ... I miss volunteering ... I miss working out ... I miss being pain-free ... I miss feeling pretty ... I miss wearing high heels ... I miss driving 5-speed ... I miss not being able to plan ahead ... I miss going to family functions ... I miss feeling immortal ... I miss my health ... I miss my old breasts ... I miss having flawless skin ... I miss a lot! Despite her uphill battle, Sandee ends each blog entry with a random thought and something for which she is thankful.

Especiallly now that The American Cancer Society is reporting that maintaining a healthy weight is at the top of their cancer prevention list.\"We know that obesity is related to a number of different cancers, breast cancer among post-menopausal women, colon cancer, esophageal, kidney cancer,\" says Colleen Doyle of American Cancer Society spokeswoman. This makes the ACS recommendations more urgent than ever. The ACS urges individuals to eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and to exercise at least five days per week.There are no guarantees, of course, that these practices will hold off cancer. But \"the good news is that a lot of people think they don\\'t have any control over their risk of cancer and we\\'re here to tell people that absolutely you do have some control,\" says Doyle.It is estimated that poor diet and lack of physical activity cause about one-third of cancer deaths each year, about the same number of cancer cases caused by smoking.

       " 'I\\'ve passed the two-year breast cancer survival mark and finally, I\\'m making a major life change. Why has it taken me so long? I\\'m not sure. I guess the time is right and it never was before. There\\'s no reason to dwell on what I could have done sooner. What matters is that I\\'m taking charge right now.First it was soda. I totally eliminated it from my diet. It wasn\\'t such a big hurdle, though, because it was never much of a habit. But sweets -- another story entirely.I love -- or shall I say loved -- sweets. Brownies, especially the gooey variety, were my favorite sugary treat. My oldest child loves them too and together, we would occasionally mix up a batch, wait impatiently while they baked, and then scarf down the whole pan.There\\'s a brownie mix in our pantry right now. Six-year-old Joey keeps asking me if we can make them. I keep telling him, \"No, mommy is not eating sweets anymore.\" Which means he is not eating sweets anymore -- unless they come from a secret source. It\\'s killing him that I won\\'t give in and make our cherished chocolate dessert. So I promised him I will make the brownies one day soon. We have an upcoming party to attend and this will be my contribution. I just can\\'t make them, keep them at home, and expect not to eat them.It\\'s been two weeks since I\\'ve consumed anything remotely sweet -- like candy, cakes, ice cream. I\\'m not counting sweeteners that are surely buried in the foods I normally eat -- I\\'ll get there eventually -- but I am committed to passing on anything obviously dripping in sugar. That means no chocolate chip cookie bars that greeted me at work one day. No dipping into the mint bowls at restaurants. No bulk-sized bag of M&amp;Ms sitting in my kitchen cupboard.Nothing. I can\\'t do it any other way. All or nothing. I\\'m going with nothing.I like how I feel. The headaches I suspected were fueled by sugar are less frequent. My stomach feels less full. I know I am headed for better health. My kids are too. My body and my wallet should lighten up a bit too.When I long for that sweet something, I reach for fresh fruit. Strawberries, apples, pears, bananas, and cantaloupe fill our kitchen now. Joey ate three bananas last night. I figure it would have been three brownies if he\\'d had the choice. For his sake and mine, I\\'m glad he didn\\'t. Comments: 1. \"No, mommy is not eating sweets anymore.\" Which means he is not eating sweets anymore...I\\'m not sure how those two statements are related.All things in moderation. 2. I admire your fortitude. Is there such thing as life after chocolate?Regards and best wishes,Richard Day Gore3.

Next time you head into your local grocery store in search of goods to fill your cupboards, your shelves, your refrigerator, I want you to try this: steer clear of the inside aisles of the store.Think about this:The healthiest foods, the freshest foods, the whole foods are housed on the outside walls of grocery stores. Fruits, vegetables, breads, meats, dairy, and often times the organic department border the aisles filled with cookies, candies, colas, crackers, cereals, dressings, and a whole host of other preserved items. So see if you can shop without entering the less-healthy regions of your store. And if you must make a detour, shoot for the most natural foods you can find. If your search is for cooking oil, opt for canola oil instead of vegetable oil. If peanut butter is your thing, pick up natural nut butters. If you must have mayonnaise, reach for reduced fat or soy versions.Staying on the perimeter of your store still requires some thinking -- meats should be lean, breads should start with the word whole, cheeses and dairy should be low in fat, and juices should be free of sugar. But still, this is the healthiest place for your next grocery store stroll. Comments: ',\n",
       " 'On Tuesday, researchers announced that a three-drug cocktail may help women with HER2-positive breast cancer better than any other drug used on its own. About one quarter of women with breast cancer make up this HER2 category.Tests on mice revealed using the three drugs along with breast cancer drug tamoxifen helped wipe out tumors altogether. And the tumors did not come back. This is the first time mice were cured of a very aggressive human breast tumor. Incidentally, when a single drug was used, tumors returned within several weeks.The three wonder drugs used in this study -- all are monoclonal antibodies that precisely target certain aspects of tumors -- are the experimental drug pertuzumab; trastuzumab, also known as Herceptin; and gefitinib, or Iressa.

So now is the time to learn a thing or two about a disease that is largely preventable, extremely deadly, and almost 100 percent curable when caught early.Think about this:Someone dies of melanoma -- the deadliest form of skin cancer -- every 65 minutes. Women ages 20-29 are most at risk, with melanoma ranking as the second most common cancer in this age group. But anyone, regardless of skin color or age, can develop skin cancer. More than one million Americans will be diagnosed with skin cancer this year -- shocking considering the cause of the disease is no secret: skin cancer is caused mostly by too much sun exposure.OK, how about some good news?In recognition of this awareness month, Olay and the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery (ASDS) have partnered for the third year and are offering a nationwide free skin cancer screening program. Desperate Housewives star Marcia Cross -- who's had two family members stricken by melanoma -- is the face of this campaign, intended to raise awareness about the importance of prevention and detection.Cross, Olay, and ASDS say regular screenings and daily protection from the sun's dangerous UV rays are the best defenses against skin cancer. And so during May, June, and July, this team is making sure your screening is free.Visit http://sev.prnewswire.com/health-care-hospitals/20070501/NYTU17101052007-1.html# to locate a dermatologist offering complimentary screenings.

Watching my little boy from behind as he propelled himself forward on our neighborhood sidewalk will be forever etched in my mind. This was before breast cancer, though. Now, after breast cancer, every step my boys take hits me like a ton of bricks.Breast cancer has turned my heart to mush. I consider it a good thing -- the depth of feeling I experience over every-day matters. I feel more grateful, thankful, and touched by life in general and by my family in particular.I credit nearly losing everything to my increased sensitivity and softness to the world around me. Life is fragile. I know that now. And for this, I have seven simple words: I promise I will never forget it. Comments: \",\n",
       " \"Post-menopausal women: stay away from barbecued and smoked meat. Or at least increase your intake of fruit and vegetables.Why?Because a new study found that post-menopausal women who ate the most grilled, barbecued, and smoked red meat over a lifetime have a 47 percent higher risk of breast cancer. Those who additionally skimped on fruits and veggies had a 74 percent increase in risk.Think about this:These findings don't show cause and effect -- a woman's high-fat diet may be partly to blame -- but they do indicate a close association. And they support current cancer prevention guidelines recommending people eat more plant-based foods and limit processed or red meat consumption.It's the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are released at high temperatures when we grill, barbecue, and smoke meat that may create the problem. Poultry and fish, when cooked in the same exact manner, did not increase breast cancer risk. And no connection was found between premenopausal women and the patterns of red meat consumption.This study is the first to examine lifetime cooked meat consumption and breast cancer risk. Clearly, the findings must be confirmed in other studies of the red meat intake. Comments: 1. One more thing surviors have to be aware of.

And Meredith Baxter is also known for her support of breast cancer research -- something not so apparent or obvious but just as significant in the scope of her life in the spotlight. Like many issues she speaks out on -- women's rights, gun control, state legislative matters -- breast cancer is an issue about which she is passionate. She has appeared at Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walks and presented gifts to the cause of breast cancer research and has starred in the 1994 television movie My Breast -- about a woman who successfully battles breast cancer. And she also has her own Meredith Baxter Foundation for Breast Cancer Research which began when she donated $10,000 to the University of Minnesota Cancer Center where her foundation was started. Much of the funding for this foundation comes from Baxter herself via the profits she makes from her own skin care products that are available in gift stores around the country. She says that life has been so kind to her that she was looking for a way to share her good fortune. So she took her concern about breast cancer prevention into the business arena. And just as she soared to success as one of the best-known TV moms, Meredith Baxter is soaring to new heights -- where she hopes to help prevent and one day cure breast cancer. Comments: 1.

       " \"I have ditched sweets -- obvious sweets like cookies, candy, ice cream, doughnuts, my favorite brownies. There's just no question they're loaded with refined sugar. And I don't want any part of it. What about foods not so apparently doused with tiny white granules? Foods with hidden amounts of refined sugar are dangerous because we don't recognize some of them as sugary. We may mistakenly believe they are healthy enough, and then overdo it when we consume these items.For comparison sake, let's consider some definite sugar-laden treats. Think in terms of teaspoons here -- actually picture a teaspoon from your silverware drawer so you can truly appreciate these totals. A four-ounce slice of chocolate cake with icing has 10 teaspoons of refined sugar. A five-ounce slice of pecan pie has 12, an 11-ounce thick shake has nine, and your average two-ounce chocolate bar has seven. Not shocking.Here's what surprises me -- 16 ounces of cola contains 12 teaspoons of refined sugar -- much higher than I would have guessed considering a glazed doughnut has six. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich has five to seven teaspoons. Eight ounces of fruit yogurt has eight, and an eight-ounce glass of chocolate milk or sweetened Kool-Aid has six.The next time you grab something to eat, check out the sugar content. It will likely be listed in grams -- one gram = .2 teaspoons -- but with a little math, you can make the conversion. If you are not very math savvy like me, try to eat foods with less than five grams of sugar. This will keep you at about one teaspoon. It will keep you on a path toward good health too.Thank you Canyon Ranch for this insight. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'Slathering on sunscreen protects us from the dangers of the sun. Right? Nope, say experts who insist protective clothing and hats are the best way to cover up against UV rays, prevent skin cancer, and minimize the aging effects of the sun.Think about this:Most of us rely on sunscreen for skin cancer prevention. But one doctor from Zurich who just finished reviewing sun protection strategies around the world says although the predominant mode of sun protection is sunscreen, this method can be abused in attempts to extend time spent in the sun.Tightly-woven, thick garmets made of denim, wool, or polyester are most effective at shielding us from harmful rays, this doctor reports. Dry, loose fabrics that shrink after washing are better than wet or stretched clothing. And cotton, linen, acetate clothing and anything that has been bleached are not very effective.It seems sunscreens are good for preventing less serious forms of skin cancer. But to protect against melanoma, the most serious from of the disease, a good cover-up is your best bet.I\\'m in a full sweat -- I live in Florida where temps are already in the 90s -- just thinking about piling on all this clothing. Comments: 1. Thanks for posting this information. Other than helping a small percentage of rodents avoid basal cell skin cancers, sunscreen has not been conclusively shown to lower the risk of skin cancer. In 1935 before sunscreen was available, the risk of melanoma was one in 1500. The risk now with sunscreen available at every convenience store is one in 84. I still tell my children to use sunscreen, but question if that slight sign of redness was a sign to head indoors in times gone past. Some studies have actually suggested that using sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer, by falsely letting people think they are safe indulging in more sunshine. Regardless of the studies, it appears \"grandma new best\", and her vastly lower risk of developing skin cancer despite lack of sunscreen was due to practicing common sense.If you must disobey grandma, there is only one sunscreen available in the U.S. that offers decent UVA protection as well as UVB. Anthelios SX(r) was only approved by the FDA late last summer, but the compound in this formula which protects against UVA rays as well as UVB, has been used in Europe and Canada for some time without adverse effects.Lynne Eldridge M.D.Co-Author, \"Avoiding Cancer One Day At A Time: Practical Advice for Preventing Cancer\"<A href=\"http://www.avoidcancernow.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.avoidcancernow.com/</A>',\n",

Scientists found 15 microRNAs more common to the cancer patients than those with chronic pancreatitis. Eight microRNAs were less common in the cancer patients, and a microRNA subgroup was linked to increased pancreatic cancer survival, making it possible to identify long-term survivors from those who would live for only about two years.Scientists must now determine what significance these microRNAs play in the pancreatic cancer process.Pancreatic cancer, a disease with no routine screening test, kills 33,000 people every year in the United States. The deadly disease is often diagnosed at very late stages due to a lack of symptoms in the early stages of the disease.

It\\'s called IPT. www.iptq.com It\\'s helped a lot of people live longer with out pain. Hugs......7. I am sorry to see anyone go like this. Here is a treatment program that can possibly buy her more time to fight another day. It\\'s called IPT ---&gt; www.iptq.com ---How It WorksInsulin Potentiation Therapy (IPT) is a true Stage IV alternative cancer treatment. It uses a combination of two orthodox drugs - insulin (actually insulin is also found in nature) and a chemotherapy drug. Cancer cells have highly active insulin receptors. With IPT the insulin works on the cell membranes and allows chemotherapy to target cancer cells. Thus, it is the chemotherapy that kills the cancer cells, however, because of the insulin, the amount of chemotherapy needed is greatly reduced, meaning the side-effects of the chemotherapy are greatly reduced. Thus, the chemotherapy is much more potent (thus the word: potentiation), much less chemotherapy is needed, and far less side-effects are experienced. Insulin is truly a \"magic bullet\" cancer treatment, meaning it allows chemotherapy to target cancer cells and results in far less side-effects. Insulin Potentiation Therapy (IPT)The word \"potentiate\" means that one substance (insulin) enhances the effectiveness of another agent (chemotherapy) and thus far less of the second agent (chemotherapy) is needed. This means far less side-effects, as well as a more effective treatment, is the result of a potentiating substance. \"Because of this favorable side effect profile, cycles of low-dose chemotherapy with IPT may be done more frequently.\"Steven G. Ayre, M.D., quoted in Treating Cancer with Insulin Potentiation Therapy page 17Not only is IPT more effective than normal chemotherapy, it can be administered more frequenly, but with less side-effects. Consider the following doses of chemotherapy required by orthodox medicine versus IPT therapists (i.e. orthodox dose to IPT dose): 1) Cisplatin (150 mg to 15 mg)2) 5-Fluorouracil (1,500 mg to 200 mg)3) Cyclophosphamide (1,500 mg to 200 mg)4) Methotrexate (60 mg to 10 mg)5) Doxorubicin (100 mg to 10 mg) \"In those undergoing treatment with IPT, an overall gentler experience promotes their concurrent use of other important elements in a program of comprehensive cancer care, which includes nutrition for immune system support and mind-body medicine to encourage a healing consciousness.Steven G. Ayre, M.D., quoted in Treating Cancer with Insulin Potentiation Therapy page 17Consider this rather long quote: \"There are numerous conditions that affect the central nervous system, including strokes (also called cerebrovascular accidents), transient ischemic attacks, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\\'s disease, dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig disease), and transverse myelitis, as well as infections from Borrelia (Lyme disease), syphilis, herpes, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), and many other organisms. As seen from this list, the treatment options for these diseases are very scarce. The primary reason that treatments for these disorders are almost nonexistent is that most medications do not adequately pass the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier retards the entry of many compounds into the brain, including chemotherapeutic agents. Theoretically, if there was a way to increase the transport of substances into the central nervous system and through the barrier, the efficacy of treatment would be greatly enhanced.\"Treating Cancer With Insulin Potentiation Therapy, Page 84Thus, insulin helps chemotherapy get past the blood-brain barrier. It does a lot of other things as well. In the \"old days\" IPT therapy required the patient to be put into an \"insulin coma.\" During those days orthodox medicine was somewhat (but not very much) justified in avoiding IPT. But today, if you find an IPT doctor who requires you to be put into an insulin coma, find another doctor. It is no longer necessary to be put into an insulin coma. With their justification of an \"insulin coma\" now gone, orthodox medicine has no excuse for not supporting IPT. It is faster working, far more effective and has virtually zero side-effects. It\\'s \"true cure rate\" is much, much higher than the \"true cure rate\" of orthodox medicine of 3%. But instead of supporting IPT, The AMA has stopped most orthodox doctors from using IPT, meaning they stopped those who were already using IPT. There may only be one IPT M.D. doctor left in the U.S. It is mostly used in Mexico. However, there are a fairly large number of D.O.s and N.D.s that use it in the U.S. (see the link below). It is strongly recommended to anyone considering IPT to buy and study the SUPERB book:Treating Cancer With Insulin Potentiation Therapy by Ross A. Hauser, M.D. and Marion A. Houser, M.S., R.D. This book is literally the \"Bible\" of IPT. The M.D. clinic most familiar with this treatment is the Nevada Center of Alternative &amp; Anti-Aging Medicine of Dr. Frank Shallenberger, M.D. He moved to Nevada specifically so he could help cancer patients. His IPT technology is state-of-the-art and he does not need to put a person into an insulin coma in order for his IPT therapy to be effective. Here is his website:Nevada Center of Alternative and Anti-Aging Medicine Here is a web page with a list of many doctors who use IPT, both in the U.S. and throughout the world. If you wish to use one of these doctors, it is recommended you ask them whether their IPT patients need to be put into an insulin coma during treatment: <A href=\"http://getipt.com/location.htm\" rel=nofollow>http://getipt.com/location.htm</A> Supercharging This TreatmentThe best way to supercharge this treatment is to find a clinic that combines IPT with DMSO Potentiation Therapy (DPT). DMSO binds to chemotherapy, then insulin opens up the membranes of the cancer cells to the chemotherapy. It is a potent combination of treatments!

       " 'We\\'re not even 11 days into Skin Cancer Awareness Month, and already my awareness about the disease has been raised several times.Today, I learned that measuring the amount of melanin in a strand of hair can predict a person\\'s risk for melanoma. It\\'s all detailed in the May 15 issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology. And the study leading to this new conclusion -- that the amount of melanin in hair indicates an individual\\'s skin type -- is quite interesting.Think about this:Researchers involved in a large skin cancer trial measured 2,3,5-pyrroletricarboxylic acid (PTCA) levels of 98 subjects with melanoma and 98 subjects without melanoma. They found the subjects with a PTCA concentration below 85ng/mg had more than four times the risk of developing melanoma.Assessing melanin levels to determine a person\\'s skin cancer risk could be used to advise patients about how often they should be screened for the disease, says Dr. Stefano Rosso from the Piedmont Cancer Registry in Italy who shares that concentrations of melanin can be measured by various means -- all of which may eventually lead to the possibility of studying the direct role melanin plays in the causes of skin tumors.Melanin is a natural substance that gives color to the hair, skin, and iris of the eye. It also protects the skin from the damaging rays of the sun.

So the American Cancer Society has teamed with the Medical Quality Assurance Inc. -- and they have co-published a guide to help these women locate a mammography center that meets their needs. This guide is sorted by city and is available on the American Cancer Society website for quick and easy access.I can only imagine how the numbers stack up in consideration of all states -- and not just Florida. I can only imagine why these one million women in my state alone have not reported for this critical test --perhaps reasons stem from lack of awareness, lack of access, lack of financial resources, lack of concern. I can only imagine that not everyone -- due to life circumstances -- can be a recipient of this potentially life-saving test. Like I was -- at the age of 34 with a small but aggressive cancerous tumor living in my left breast. My referral for a mammogram saved my life.

       " \"I went to Canyon Ranch a little more than a week ago for several reasons. I went to do some research for a magazine article -- not a bad job assignment -- and I went to pursue guidance about nutrition, fitness, mind-body healing, stress management, pampering -- of course -- and overall post-breast cancer health. I found everything I wished to find, and I ended up with few pearls of wisdom I hadn't ever expected to dig up.Canyon Ranch has a whole medical facility on their Tucson grounds, and I had the pleasure of spending an hour of my stay talking with a brilliant female doctor who asked all about my history and then made a few suggestions for better living. One suggestion I found very intriguing.It hasn't hit the whole medical community yet, but testing for levels of vitamin D is a wise pursuit for women concerned about breast cancer risk and recurrence, said this doctor who did her own little research experiment recently. Looking at levels of vitamin D in women at all spectrums of health, this doctor found those with breast cancer had low levels of vitamin D in their bodies. Those without breast cancer tended to have higher levels. She tested herself too and found her levels were right on target -- not surprising since she takes a vitamin supplement and lives in a very sunny climate.Aha -- the sun. It turned out women who lived in not-so-sunny places had lower levels of vitamin D. It all started coming together for this doctor who now recommends a simple blood test for women who care to chart their levels. If they are identified as low, the women can take preventative steps, like taking supplements, soaking up a few minutes of sun each day, regulating diet and exercise, and more.There is a thread of research out there on this topic -- read more here -- and if what this one doctor shared with me is as accurate as it seems, I suspect vitamin D testing could become a trend for the future.Thanks to my doctor friend at Canyon Ranch for this insight.

She went through 6 months of cemotherapy and numerous laser surgery attempts before finally losing the battle for 1 of her eyes. She has since lived very healthy for over 6 years cancer free and is a star student. She has decent vision in her remaining eye and does everything any other 7 year old would.2.

For more information on this go to curesearch.org.Thank you!!!!! 4. My husband Alex and I are from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and are very supportive fans of Mr. Fisher. May God keep him and his family safe and keep His loving hand of protection around Tatum. It is difficult to have something so intimate and personal in the public eye; however, it can be used to educate the world on the condidtion and other cancer related issues. God bless.5. What a dad! Visit my blog to see my take on Derek and his daughter. <A href=\"http://mrcsblog111.blogspot.com/\" rel=nofollow>http://mrcsblog111.blogspot.com/</A>6. I am writing from Jakarta, Indonesia.My 1 year old baby son has recently being diagnosed of either Retinoblastoma or PHPV (congenital eye disease). Since we have not being provided with a firm diagnosis, we are not able to make any such life decision for my baby.We have tried to search very hard for the right ophtalmologist in state (maybe) who can help us in giving a clearer diagnosis so we would know what we should do for our baby. We hope anyone out there, who read this, could help us in providing the information as we do not have any resources at the moment. Thanks. 7. My very good friend\\'s little girl was diagnosed with retinoblastoma at age 4. They had to remove her eye. She is now a 17 year old junior in high school, a national merit scholar and an accomplished musician who speaks 3 languages fluently. She has been cancer free for many years now. I wish Derek and his family the best.8. Please tell Mr. &amp; Mrs. Derek Fisher that Tatum will be fine in spite of the next few messy weeks. It is hard to go through cancer treatment, harder still for a parent to watch their child be treated. But retinoblastoma is no longer a death threat when caught early.My sister was 2 years old when she had her first operation. It took 2 years and 4 operations to get her into remission, but the ordeal was successful, and 52 years later, she is a happy, healthy school teacher who reads avidly in spite of having only one functioning eye. She got her first glasses when she became old enough to need reading glasses - long after her hair became gray from teaching hundreds of rambunctious children, and then the children of her former students. Her major complaint is that she is charged the same price as I am by our eye dr, and she only has one eye.Hang in there. I know it is frightening right now, but Sloan Kettering is one of the best, and has been for over 50 years. Your daughter is in good hands. With the modern treatments your daughter will be well in no time. We shall pray for you all.Bubbie Allyn9. My granddaughter has just been diagnosed with retinoblastoma in both eyes. She is 6 months old and will be going to St. Jude hospital for treatment.10. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions on how to contact Derek Fisher, it would be appreciated. Unfortunetly the information he\\'s going to be given about retinoblastoma from the western model of medicine he is pursuing will be completely false. It\\'s really unfortunate because he\\'s going to put his daughter and family through a completely unneccessary and risky ordeal.Retinoblastoma, as an \\'inherited\\' mutated gene is completely curable through proper diet and knowledge. He\\'s not going to be told this however, and will end up pumping tons of toxins into his childs body out of fear and lack of knowledge.As a Derek Fisher fan (I\\'m in Los Angeles), if anyone has contact information, or suggestions about how to contact him, please let me know. Thanks.11. Our prayers are with you and your family....my son has gone through a battle with a brain cancer called medulablastoma.. he is cancer free for 2 years. I would suggest you check out the survivir rates at St Judes Chldhood cancer hospital..I can\\'t say enough about them We traveled from Northern California to Memphis TN and it was well worth it..They are awesome and definately put the care and treatment of the chilf first..Are prayers are with you and your family at this dificult time12. University of Minnesota Fairview Medical Center: <A href=\"http://www.fairview-university.fairview.org/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.fairview-university.fairview.org/</A>Tammy Dulian is a cancer survivor and so is her son Zack, who was treated at UM Fairview. Tammy can be contacted at: tammy_j_dulian@uhc.com. 13. The name of the hospital little Zack was at is University of Minnesota Fairview Medical Center. 14. My friend\\'s son was diagnosed with retinoblastoma in both eyes when he was about 3 months old. His cancer was hereditary since my friend was diagnosed with it, and lost an eye, when she was about the same age. Although it robbed her of one eye, her son\\'s eyes were both saved thanks a children\\'s cancer hosptial in Minnesota and he has been cancer-free for almost 2 years (he will be 3 years old in August). He is still monitored regularly to ensure that the cancer does not return. My prayers are with you and your family that Tatum will receive treatment and be cancer-free. Your decision to take time to be with your family is an admirable one. 15. Mr. Fisher you are a man, a real man. You are the perfect role model for all men. God bless you, your daughter and your family.16. I\\'m sorry to hear as a Boston Celtics fan about Derek Fisher and his daughter Tatum.I wish all our prayers around the world for Derek and his daughter.I wish them both the best of luck and getting the best treatment possible.It\\'s a hard thing in his career and he\\'s right about family coming first,It\\'s just so unfortunate and unfair to Tatum as a young child.Maybe in the future Derek I hope makes a comeback after everything goes well w/ Tatum.I just want to let Derek and Tatum know,as well his family.My prayers and thoughts are w/ them.I hope everyone can reach out and share messages w/ Derek to let him we know we are all thinking of him.In these harsh times of his career.-God Bless Derek,Tatum and Fam. 17. Dear Mr. Fisher, I am a mother of twins. My one daughter had this disease and lost her left eye as well. She is 6 years old now and she was 3 when I seen the white in her eye. My other daughter didn\\'t have the disease. I had wonderful doctors at Columbus children\\'s hospital in Ohio. Dr. Rogers and Dr. Ranilla was wonderful. I am on a fixed income so I don\\'t have the means to travel as you do.. so if it not to much to ask if you find any great eye specialist that make actifical eye please contract me or have someone... I would do anything to make the eye look real for her ..She is having problems with her other classmates because of it. .. but all for that one problem my daughter has been cancer free for three years .. knock on wood...she is doing very well in life and health ways... I hope for the best for your daughter i know how hard it is to have one health twin and one sick one.... sometime as a parent it is hard to choose what one child gets your attention... All i can say is thank god for grandma and grandpa....but as my daughter gets old we have put her into therepy for depth vision and hands on help... but she loves sports and she is wonderful for being 6....thanks so much for sharing your story with all of us.. more information out there on the disease will help save more lives and eye in the future... Thanks again carrie18. My name it Tom and back in 1969 I was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma back then there were not the options that exist today and the chances of recovery were not as good. Needless to say my eye was removed and I went through both chemo and radiation. I am now 44, there is life after this and my heart and prayers are with the Fisher family.19. The road does get easier. My baby Hailee was 15 months old when we discovered the white flex in one of her eyes. It was like a nightmare.The pediatrician didn\\'t believe that anything was wrong. Hailee finally went to see a specialist who removed the cancer from her body (eye). Luckily we didn\\'t give Hailee chemo due to the pathology report and lots of caring doctors who wanted to help. She has been cancer-free for 11 years. She is very bright and has a tough attitude. There isn\\'t much she can\\'t do. She has done Relay for Life in Gainesville, Fl(American Cancer Society) for the past 5 years and has already received over $9,000 in donations for cancer. May be that was why she was chosen. I would like to tell the family to get the book \"My Fake Eye\" as well as have everyone write in a diary about their feelings. My son was about 6 when we wrote to the bad eye after Hailee\\'s operation. We were thankful that it happened in the eye where we could see it because it would be worse if it was somewhere else in her body.As long as they stat strong for each other, they will be fine. I hope they watch their other children. The siblings get hit very hard.Be strong and the baby will make it and be strong too.20. I feel for Mr. Fisher\\'s family tragedy. It is a horrible journey when you child is suffering. My son was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma 9 years ago on his 1st birthday. The cancer progressed to the point where the eye could not be saved and was removed. The cancer did not penetrate the optic nerve, so there was no need for chemo. God blessed us with this miracle. The care he received from Dr. Maumenie (Dr. Momma to my then one year old) at the Wilmer Institute in Baltimore was compationate, informative and definitely the best in the world. I don\\'t doubt for one moment that removing his eye wasn\\'t the best decision for my son. Tim Freil in Bethesda created a beautiful prosthetic eye that is natural looking and comfortable for my son to wear. Mr. Freil is personable and freindly with small children, making my son enjoy his appointments with him. My son is a beautiful, active, wonderful, brave and a unique child who has been cancer free for 9 years. I will pray for you Mr. Fisher that God gives you the strength and clear understanding of all the decisons you will need to make affecting your baby daughter. I will be praying for her. God Bless, Sher',\n",

       " \"It's been one year since I began writing for The Cancer Blog. According to statistics generated by this site, I've written 27,381 words and 793 posts. If you've been reading for this entire time, you surely know a lot about me. Not only do my posts reflect current news and issues, but they feature all sorts of personal stuff too. When considered together, my work here reflects just about every piece of my cancer journey, my inner most thoughts, my morals and values, my take on the world. But for those of you who haven't been reading for long, for those who have forgotten how I fit into the cancer puzzle, for those who want a recap, here's a rundown on me: Jacki Donaldson.I was born and raised in Ohio but have also lived in Nevada, Virginia, and Florida -- my current home. My life always went pretty much according to plan -- I lived happily with my parents and one sister, faithfully attended school, went to college, got married, had two baby boys and a series of good jobs, and had just begun commenting to my family members about how lucky our family was not to have been affected by cancer. It seems just as I spoke this aloud, cancer arrived.I was diagnosed with breast cancer -- stage I, no lymph node involvement, ER/PR negative, HER2 positive -- in November 2004 at the age of 34. My boys were almost four and 18 months old. My world seemed shattered. But now that my lumpectomy, dose-dense chemotherapy, radiation, and year-long Herceptin drug therapy is complete, everything is just fine.It took almost two years of counseling and anti-depressant treatment for me to emerge from the behind the cloud of cancer. And my mission in writing about my journey is to spread the word: there is life after cancer. And it can be sweeter than ever imagined.Cancer gave me a wake-up call, a jolt, a reminder that I must make the most of my days. It gave me focus, simplicity, wonder, easy living. Much to my surprise, after first declaring a journalism major 18 years ago, it gave me a writing career. And it is my pleasure to write for you.

I have recently turned 34 am 26 weeks pregnant and diagnosed with breast cancer in April this year (2007).I am currently going through chemo and have lost all my long straight black hair and wonder what it will look like one day when it grows back :)But chief among my worries really is to be able to have a healthy baby and survive cancer - long term! And begin to enjoy motherhood and family.Please continue to write as I and many other people are interested in your progress.In case people would like to know, my cancer diagnosis is similar to Jacki's, but I've had a mastectomy - my tumour was considerably larger, one node was positive and I'm strongly HER2 positive.\",\n",
       " \"I'm a good runner when it comes to the right state of mind and the right weather. I have to feel a spark of motivation to know I'll succeed at running, and I prefer cool temperatures. Something in the low 70s or below is perfect. When it's hot and steamy and humid in my Florida town, I tend to struggle. Like I did today.I set out for a three-mile run with my head in the game. The air was a bit too warm for my liking, but I pushed myself anyway. For a good long time, I did well. With loud music blaring on my MP3 player and a steady pace, I conquered about 75 percent of my goal. Then something happened. I felt my body slow, and my feet wanted to stop. They almost did. Instead of giving in and giving up, though, I pushed myself to finish. In the end, it felt good.My advice to you today is this: just when you feel you are fading, fading, fading -- don't quit. Try to get through the moment and you'll likely find some energy to keep plugging away.It could be exercise, diet, a job, a family conflict, or even cancer that has you wilting. Try to dig deep into your inner strength and plow right through. Now if you are on the brink of something catastrophic or life-threatening, I urge you to seek professional assistance. But if you judge your scenario to be one you can realistically overcome, I say: keep charging forward, and don't look back.

       " 'A new study reveals that women who received childhood cancer treatment may enter menopause much earlier than women who are not childhood cancer survivors. Siblings were studied -- 2,800 women who did receive treatment and 1,000 sisters of cancer survivors who did not. Women who underwent ovary-removing surgery were excluded from the study -- and the study then found that eight percent of cancer survivors experienced early menopause and less than one percent of the sisters experienced the same phenomenon. The risk was highest -- 30 percent -- for those who once received radiation to the lower abdomen and who also received certain chemotherapy agents, such as cyclophosphamide. Researchers say that 30 percent may be an underestimate, however, because the study included mostly women who had not yet reached age 40. The number of childhood cancer survivors over age 40 entering early menopause is still unclear. What is clear are the unfortunate consequences of this finding that could affect family planning, middle age health, thinning bones, other problems associated with menopause. Comments: 1.

       " \"I think I would feel pretty alone if it weren't for all the support out there for cancer. All the recognition given to cancer patients and survivors. All the cancer information floating around. And all the survivors who hold each other up in times of distress and despair. What a horrible thing that cancer is so widespread that there has to be so much focus on this life-threatening disease. But how wonderful that all this attention can have such great outcomes. At the infusion center I visit every three weeks for a dose of Herceptin for breast cancer, there are two social workers available for patients. There are genetic counselors and psychologists. There are signs and posters all over the medical facilities advertising support groups and studies. There are organizations like Sacred Cliffs and Chemo Angels. And there is Team Survivor.Team Survivor, started in 1995 in conjunction with the Danskin Women's Triathlon Series, exists to provide free weekly exercise programs and periodic fitness events and education for all women affected by cancer. Programs have grown throughout the U.S. and in my city alone, women can attend events such as yoga and tai chi and walking groups. Some travel all over the state to participate in dragon boating, biking, and triathlons. They also gather for social camaraderie and support. Their goal is to encourage physical activity for women of all ages and stages of fitness and in all stages of cancer treatment and recovery.Team Survivor grew of out the unfortunate existence of cancer.&nbsp; But it helps women grow and develop and succeed physically.&nbsp; And that is a gift.

       " 'We\\'re still basking in the hot sun, bronzing our bodies in tanning beds, and playing outdoors without slathering on the sunscreen. What will it take, I wonder, for our society to catch on, to take real steps toward preventing skin cancer?It seems education isn\\'t enough. Most of us know by now all it takes is one bad sunburn to increase our risk of skin cancer, yet we continue to collect burn after burn after burn. Perhaps like all habit-forming behaviors -- think smoking -- it takes something tragic in our lives to inspire change. When someone we know gets lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking or someone we know develops melanoma after years of sunbathing, maybe we get the hint. MaybeNow, I know you don\\'t personally know this young woman -- she calls herself Miss Melanoma -- but I suggest you read her story. And I recommend you take what happened to her -- she lost part of her foot to melanoma and is currently battling a spread of the disease -- and allow it to really sink in, allow it to motivate you to take cover from the sun, before something like this happens to you. Because it can.The NumbersCancer of the skin is the most common of all cancers. Melanoma, the deadliest form of the disease, accounts for three percent of all skin cancer cases. The number of new cases is on the rise in the United States, and the American Cancer Society predicts there will be 59,940 new diagnoses in 2007. About 8,110 will die from melanoma during this same year.Presentation and Risk FactorsMelanoma, typically presented in the form of a brown or black mole, often appears on the trunk of fair-skinned men and on the lower legs of fair-skinned women -- but it can occur in other locations too. And while those with dark skin have a decreased risk of the disease, dark-skinned people can still develop melanoma.No one knows exactly what causes melanoma, but we do know that certain risk factors are linked to the disease. Too much exposure to UV radiation from the sun, tanning beds, and booths; the presence of certain moles; fair skin; family history; immune suppression; advanced age; and gender -- men are more likely to contract this cancer -- all serve to increase risk. But like all cancers, not everyone with risk factors will get the disease and those with no risk factors may still develop it.PreventionPrevention is key. We should all avoid too much exposure to the sun, avoid the sun during the middle of the day when UV light is most intense, cover up with clothing and hats, wear sunscreen and lip balm with SPF of 15 or more, wear sunglasses with 99 percent UV absorption, avoid tanning beds, and report to the doctor with any suspicious moles.We must all be vigilant about checking our own skin once per month. Any change in the pattern of moles, freckles, and other marks should be reported to our physicians who can conduct clinical skin exams.DetectionIf a doctor suspects melanoma, he/she will take a sample of the skin for investigation under a microscope. This biopsy process can take several forms. An incisional biopsy removes a portion of the skin tumor. An excisional biopsy removes the entire tumor. A shave biopsy takes off the top layers of the skin. A punch biopsy takes a deeper sample of the skin. Excisional biopsies are mostly used when melanoma is suspected.DiagnosisWhen melanoma is diagnosed, an important question arises: has the disease spread? To make this determination, fine needle aspirations, lymph node biopsies, sentinel node biopsies, x-rays, CT scans, MRI, PET scans, and nuclear bone scans are used.StagingMelanoma is staged using 0 and the Roman numerals I-IV. The lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, such as IV, indicates a more serious cancer. Each melanoma tumor is measured. The thinner the melanoma, the better the outlook. Mostly, melanomas less than 1/25 of an inch in depth -- about the size of a period or a comma -- have a very small chance of spreading. Tumors that are ulcerated -- the covering layer of skin is absent -- have worse prognoses. Tumor thickness also helps guide treatment.TreatmentSome melanomas can be completely cured by a minor surgery called simple excision. Sometimes amputation is necessary, along with lymph node dissection. If the cancer has spread, doctors assume it cannot be cured by surgery. Chemotherapy can become an option in these cases, although it is not often successful for melanoma. Immunotherapy -- designed to boost the immune system in its attack against the disease -- can be used and so can radiation. Radiation is not typically used for the original tumor but to treat cancer that has spread.SurvivalThe five-year-survival rate for melanoma is as follows:Stage 0 = 97 percentStage I = 90 to 95 percentStage II = 45 to 78 percentStage III - 28 to 70 percentStage IV = 18 percentThe information contained in this post is by no means exhaustive.

Melanoma, the deadliest form of the disease, accounts for three percent of all skin cancer cases. The number of new cases is on the rise in the United States, and the <A href=\"http://www.cancer.org/\">American Cancer Society</A> predicts there will be 59,940 new diagnoses in 2007.

And while those with dark skin have a decreased risk of the disease, dark-skinned people can still develop melanoma.No one knows exactly what causes melanoma, but we do know that certain risk factors are linked to the disease.

The model, complete with normal cells and tumor cells, should help experts understand how the disease develops in its early stages, and it could replace the need for experiments in animals.About one in five breast cancers in the UK start out as DCIS. Researchers wanted to learn more about how the early cancerous changes in cells develop into larger tumors, and they chose to fashion a 3D test tube model because it is more complex than a layer of cells in a Petri dish.Once this experiment is proved successful, it could reduce and perhaps replace animal studies.\"With breast cancer, there is an urgent need to move away from animal research models because their similarity to human cancer can be so poor,\" says one expert who explains this model could help revolutionize breast cancer research -- because unreliable research costs time, money, and lives, both animal and human lives.

       " 'It seems strange, say researchers, but new evidence from Johns Hopkins shows that cancer cells seem to gain momentum when they switch to a low-energy oxygen mode.\"There must be a strong advantage to cancer cells to stop using a highly efficient process in favor of one that generates much less energy,\" according to researcher Gregg Semenza whose findings appear in the May 8 issue of Cancer Cell.Usually, cancer cells are powered by mitochondria and they use oxygen to create energy. But researchers found when studying Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL), a genetic disorder causing tumors throughout the body, that VHL switches on a gene that makes cells favor glucose and not oxygen.A cancer cell\\'s appetite for glucose is very strong and so researchers, scientists at the National Cancer Institute, and pharmaceutical experts are further exploring this phenomenon so it can be useful in cancer therapy.

Of all the chemical exposures, some of the most serious ... and almost forgotten ... are the banned pesticides and PCBs. These chemicals are still used in tens of thousands of tons per year quantities in the developing world. Recent research has shown that these toxins circulate through the air to give us hundreds of millions of molecules per breathful to inhale and contaminate all waters they contact. Lake Superior, the largest and northernmost of the Great Lakes has increased 50% in toxaphene contamination since it was banned in the 1980s. Its trout have ten times the hazardous waste limit of toxaphene! We will not be safe from persistent pesticides and PCBs untill after they are globally banned. Learn more at coldclearanddeadly.com.4.

       " 'Drugs currently in trials for obesity and diabetes may soon be fast-tracked for use in the fight against breast cancer. Typically, it takes many years to research and develop new drugs. But these already-developed drugs, if successful, could reach the market much quicker.The drugs, believed to work by blocking the enzyme PTP1B, could help breast cancer patients because the enzyme is found in high levels in about 40 percent of these patients.Studies on mice show blocking production of the enzyme significantly slowed tumor development. In some cases, it stopped the spread of the cancer and it might even stop some tumors from forming.This is \"very important and surprising,\" says one researcher who remarked that the excitement over this discovery is that we won\\'t have to wait for several years of research. The compound has already been developed -- and that\\'s great news.Clinical trials for diabetes have shown the drug to have very low toxicity in comparison to other cancer treatments. So side effects are minimal.Within months, researchers hope to begin investigating the role of PTP1B in other types of cancer, primarily ovarian cancer and certain types of adult leukemia.As for breast cancer, it\\'s predicted the breast cancer patients with HER2 positive disease will be the group most likely to benefit from these new drugs. Combining the drugs with Herceptin -- a targeted drug therapy believed to cut recurrence by up to 50 percent in these women -- could provide a \"two-way kill,\" say experts.

He merely used his own body.We are everything we need to get fit. Our bodies are tools. We can use them to do push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, dips, squats, lunges, wall sits, planks. We can walk, run, sprint, jump, balance, and more. We need nothing more than our own body weight, really, to achieve greatness.

I have two scars -- one underneath my armpit, one across the side of my left breast -- and while they are sometimes obvious if I wear a sleeveless shirt, they don\\'t really bother me so much. Some women -- about one-third to be exact -- are bothered by their lumpectomy results. Even though lumpectomy is intended to conserve the breast, these women say they are so unhappy about how their breasts look, they would consider reconstruction surgery.According to a study presented at the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) Plastic Surgery 2006 conference in San Francisco, 28 percent of breast cancer patients stated they were dissatisfied with the cosmetic outcome of surgery. Of these, 46 percent believed their physical appearance was worse or much worse after surgery. Interestingly, 26 percent of these unsatisfied patients still said surgery gave them an improved sense of body image. Plastic surgeons believe this disparity stems from the relief of having had cancer removed from their bodies, leading them to feel better even though they were not happy with how their breasts looked.It all comes down to this: \"Patients should know their options and understand that just because they undergo a lumpectomy to save their breast does not mean they will be happy with the cosmetic outcome,\" said Howard Wang, ASPS Member Surgeon and co-author of the study. \"Oncologists need to work with patients to help them understand the potential physical outcomes and refer them to a board-certified plastic surgeon to consider all of their choices.\" Comments: It all comes down to this: \"Patients should know their options and understand that just because they undergo a lumpectomy to save their breast does not mean they will be happy with the cosmetic outcome,\" said Howard Wang, ASPS Member Surgeon and co-author of the study. \"Oncologists need to work with patients to help them understand the potential physical outcomes and refer them to a board-certified plastic surgeon to consider all of their choices.\"1.

       " \"As Skin Cancer Awareness Month winds down, I find myself hoping you have learned a thing or two about a disease that is far more common than we tend to believe, a diseases that in some cases is downright deadly. The month of May will soon drift away. Skin cancer will not -- unless of course we make huge, swift strides in prevention. Until this happens, though, the best we can do is be vigilant about early detection. I have an idea. Well, an idea I'm borrowing from The Archives of Dermatology.The idea: photography. Studies show patients who use photographs of their own skin for reference are better able to detect skin changes while conducting self-examinations.Got a camera handy? A buddy who can snap a few shots? If so, you may just save yourself from melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer.Atypical nevi -- pigmented moles that may change shape or have irregular borders -- are the strongest risk factor for melanoma. The presence of numerous atypical nevi can make self-exams difficult. And because total removal of all moles is impractical, close self-monitoring is critical.Consider taking some baseline shots of every nook and cranny of your skin, especially the parts populated by moles, freckles, and other marks. Save the pictures. During your next self-exam, use the photos for comparison. You can even take new pictures of old moles and determine whether or not they've changed over time. As with all early detection for all cancers, much of the work is up to the individual. So do your part. Please. Comments: Got a camera handy? A buddy who can snap a few shots?

       " \"I'm not sure where I was headed professionally before cancer. I knew I was happy as a stay-at-home mom, and I didn't give much thought to what might come next. I was pretty certain I would not do what I did before kids -- college administration and counseling -- and that's as far as I'd gotten in my decision-making process. It seems cancer would have further confused my future intentions. But it didn't. Instead, it led me in a direction I may have otherwise never discovered. First, it guided me to a part-time position at my kids' preschool. Just after surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation and in the midst of Herceptin breast cancer treatment, I felt a strong urge to reenter the world of the living. One day as I was dropping off my oldest child at his Pre-K class, I noticed an advertisement on the doors of the school. I inquired within -- and got a job working two afternoons per week. The job was a blessing. I got to see my kids while I worked, interact with loving adults and children, and distract myself from the darkness of cancer.For two years, I worked at this preschool.

       " 'Herceptin -- a targeted breast cancer drug used to treat women who are Her2 positive -- has received rave reviews and has shown great promise in cutting down on recurrence of this aggressive form of breast cancer. Given over the course of 52 weeks, Herceptin is wondrous for its lack of short-term side effects. There is no hair loss, no compromise of blood counts, no significant sickness. For me, fatigue may have resulted from this treatment -- but it\\'s unclear to me really whether it was the Herceptin or the two small boys I have living in my house that most contributed to my occasional exhaustion. Regardless, I functioned well while receiving Herceptin for the past year -- and I did not suffer anything more than a twinge of pain when my port was accessed for each treatment. In the short term, I have fared well. In the long term, the jury is still out.Heceptin is known for it\\'s long-term toxicity on the heart, especially when used with Adriamycin -- a typical breast cancer chemotherapy agent -- which is also toxic to the heart.&nbsp; Heart damage as a result of Herceptin is not common but the heart\\'s ability to effectively pump blood can be compromised. Rarely -- about five percent of the time -- women can experience stroke or life-threatening congestive heart failure. And seven percent of the time, Herceptin causes mild heart failure. The only way to determine if the heart is suffering before symptoms or problems arise is through heart monitoring before, during, and after Herceptin therapy.So this afternoon, I will report to the hospital for an echocardiogram -- a test that uses sound waves to take pictures of my heart as it pumps blood. I will lie still -- on my side mostly -- while a technician moves around a device on my ribs, over my heart. The whole procedure takes just a few minutes and then a determination will be made about the health of my heart -- now that it\\'s weathered both Adriamycin and Herceptin. This will be my third echocardiogram. I was tested before my first dose of Herceptin and then again in the midst of treatment. Both tests revealed a healthy heart and no damage. I hope -- and I am confident -- that this third peek into my heart will reveal more of the same. And if not -- if my heart has suffered some damage -- function can be restored by drugs that strengthen the heart. It\\'s a trade-off -- this cancer treatment thing. In order to survive breast cancer, I must survive the treatment that may lengthen my life but may also limit my body\\'s ability to function in other areas. Someone once told me that I should be so lucky to have a problem with my heart years and years from now -- because it means I would have lived long enough with breast cancer to encounter such a problem. It\\'s amazing how perspective changes with cancer. Never before would I have been content with the knowledge that my heart might one day fail me. Compared to a possible death sentence from breast cancer, though, it seems like a not-so-bad option. And what an odd comfort that is. Comments: 1. I hope this technology will be brought to masses and we at last will find cancer treatment2. Another great post JackiI\\'ve been encouraged by data from the recent HERA study - a large study of herceptin in women with early breast cancer. It seems to show (so far) that heart damage is much less common that was previously thought. As you say - its all still very early days - but here\\'s hoping that there are no long term effects waiting to be unveiled. Like all things in life however - there\\'s a trade off isn\\'t there. We all simply need to decide if the price is worth paying - and I couldn\\'t agree more with your comments on that front. Best wishes3. It\\'s a cautionary tale. Herceptin combined with standard chemotherapy will have as many as 4% of women who take the regimen develop symptoms of congestive heart failure, compared with less than 1% of women given chemotherapy alone. It\\'s one of those things that benefits a very few patients a whole lot, is neutral in most, and is bad in a few.Overt congestive heart failure is a very late and serious manifestation of heart muscle damage. For every patient with frank congestive heart failure, there is probably another two, three, four or five patients with heart muscle damage short of congestive heart failure. The sort of heart muscle damage which can cause fatigue and/or shortness of breath with moderate or mild exertion, which otherwise wouldn\\'t occur.Herceptin has been in use only a few years. We don\\'t know what will happen 10 or 20 years from now in women who didn\\'t need any adjuvant therapy at all, who would have been cured by surgery alone. Only a minority of patients who receive adjuvant therapy benefit from it. Adjuvant therapy is worth it if the women have to suffer only short term, temporary toxicity, and if it even slightly reduces the probability that their cancers will come back. But if it produces permanent toxicity, whether \"chemo brain\" or \"heart muscle damage,\" that is a whole different order of magnitude in terms of risk.Monoclonal antibodies like Herceptin are enormous. Very large molecules don\\'t have a convenient way of getting access to the large majority of cells. Plus, there is multicellular resistance, the drug affecting only the cells on the outside may not kill these cells if they are in contact with cells on the inside, which are protected from the drug. The cells may pass small molecules back and forth. This needs further evaluation. I just hope that a prospective, randomized clinical trial is not the way to go about it.4. Gregory\\'s comments above are interesting. Indeed he posted virtually identical remarks on our blog site at <A href=\"http://www.twinkletwinkles.com/2006/06/herceptin-look-out-theyre-at-it-again.html\" rel=nofollow>http://www.twinkletwinkles.com/2006/06/herceptin-look-out-theyre-at-it-again.html</A>If you search for Gregory\\'s name on Google you\\'ll see that he has been a forceful, articulate and intelligent advocate for his views for some time now.His stance and viewpoint certainly gives food for thought - but there\\'s no doubt that he stands fairly firmly in the camp of those who would seriously question whether chemotherapy / herceptin and the likes should be used at all in the adjuvant setting. I\\'m not saying that his views are not well thought out - they very obviously are. Nor am I saying that they may not have some validity - they might and research is now turning towards those very questions.But I would caution those who read the above comments to keep in mind that Gregory has his own agenda to promote.Hope this helps Gordon5. I was a spouse/caregiver to an ovarian cancer patient. I became intensely interested in cancer medicine by virtue of working through, enduring and surviving my wife\\'s illness. I\\'ve gotten a street education by virtue of voluminous reading and hundreds of hours of past and ongoing personal communication with noted authorities in the field.There is seldom a \"standard\" therapy which has been proven to be superior to any other therapy. When all studies are compared by meta-analysis, there is no difference.There are so many new drugs coming down the pike that there is simply no way to evaluate them in prospective, randomized clinical trials. Some trials are positive, some are negative, and it\\'s only after ten years or so that have gone by and 10,000 patients or so, have been enrolled in the trials that anyone can draw conclusions. And by then, what had been the \"standard\" treatment has now changed, because of all the new drugs which have been introduced. And I wouldn\\'t suggest they hold these new drugs hostage to the really unachievable standard of prospective, randomized clinical trials.The best chance for discovering the right formula is having \"all\" the drugs available to oncologists, and allow creativity and insight and the \"Art of Medicine\" enter into the process. A \"standard\" therapy would not be for everyone, but having a lot of tools (drugs) available and making use of various tests (molecular and cellular) to match treatment to the patient.I\\'m not so sure I would describe it as having my own agenda, but being an advocate for a number of cancer subjects. To paraphrase Martin Luther King Jr: \"A scientific communication should be judged on the quality of its content and only secondarily, or not at all, on the qualifications of its author.\"6. Thanks again GregoryI respect your stand point and completely agree that your contribution can and should be judged on its quality. I\\'m quite certain that you are as well versed in the literature as many oncologists - and better versed than some. Certainly better versed than me!As you correctly say \"some trials are positive, some are negative, and it\\'s only after ten years or so that have gone by and 10,000 patients or so, have been enrolled in the trials that anyone can draw conclusions\"Those of us long in the tooth in medicine know thats always been the case - and not only for cancer drugs or treatments. But of course - we have to live in the day to day world too. As a doctor I can only do the best I can with the knowledge I have. As the partner of a breast cancer sufferer, Marjory and I can only work as a team to tackle this thing head on - using our intelligence and our instincts (and our reading) to find the path that suits us best.The last bit is the most important. All of those dealing with cancer should remain involved enough in their care to figure out what \"suits them best\" and to then stick with that decision and live with its consequences. No one has the right answers except the cancer sufferer themselves. Doctors and guys like us posting on blogs can provide input - but in the end the individual and their family have to figure it out for themselves.Marjory and I weighed up all our options - came to a decision and will now run with it. We\\'ll either do well or we won\\'t - but at least we\\'ve been involved and in control throughout.Marjory is drawn more to the views that Jacki expressed in her original post. If heart problems come down the line then let them come. Yeah - we will have to deal with it if and when it happens but at least she will be here to deal with it.I agree with you - there is a tendency to jump for any new breakthrough and to grab the good news without properly considering the down sides. Not all women will benefit from herceptin. Some will be harmed. Maybe time will show more harm than benefit. But for now the balancing act has to be achieved and the decisions taken by the individual.Staying positive is vital. Hope is crucial - even in the bleakest of circumstances. Losing hope is a disaster. Being as informed as you can be is very important - and your postings are a vital part in helping build the big picture. Many of those with cancer will find what you write deeply disturbing and painful to read. Some will misinterpret your intent but balance in life is everything. The light seems all the brighter when you\\'ve properly looked at the darkness.I do not intend any criticism of your writing or your views - your input is a vital part of the jigsaw. Keep at it. Keep questioning. Keep shaking the foundations. But bear in mind the pain that your questions cause for those who are already committed to their own path.Best wishesGordonPS - this is the most sustained discussion that I\\'ve seen on this blog. Jacki .. Dalene ... what do a couple of guys need to do to get a gold star around here?? 7. Dear Gregory &amp; Gordan -- Thank you both so much for your commentary on my post about Herceptin and the forces that make it promising and questionable at the same time. I love that my liimited input on the topic has created this great discourse that is definitely thought-provoking for me -- and hopefully for others too.Thank you,Jacki Donaldson8. My comment about Monoclonal antibodies like Herceptin being enormous, may be a reason targeted \"small-molecule\" therapies ruled at the annual ASCO meeting of oncologists. The most exciting results shown came from studies of multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, small molecules that act on multiple receptors in the cancerous cells, like Tykerb and Sutent.The trend is away from the monoclonals to the small molecules, a trend which a new predictive test (EGFRx) may be able to hasten. The EGFRx (TM) assay will test molecularly-targeted anti-cancer drugs therapies Iressa, Tarceva, Sutent and possibly Nexavar, because of being small molecules.However, drugs like Avastin (although a monoclonal antibody) can be tested with EGFRx (TM) because the target of Avastin is not the cells themselves, but rather a hormone (VEGF) secreted by the tumor cells. The Avastin complexes with free VEGF and blocks its action. The EGFRx (TM) test can discriminate between the activity of different targeted drugs and identify situations in which it is advantageous to combine the targeted drugs with other types of cancer drugs.Most patients are treated not with a targeted therapy drug alone but with a combination of chemotherapy drugs and clinical studies should not be generalized to all patients with cancer (each is different). The EGFRx (TM) assay relies upon a technique known as â\\x80\\x9cWhole Cell Profilingâ\\x80? in which living tumour cells are removed from an individual cancer patient and exposed in the laboratory to the new drugs.A variety of metabolic and apoptotic measurements are then used to determine if a specific drug was successful at killing the patient\\'s cancer cells. The whole cell profiling method assesses the activity of a drug upon combined effect of all cellular processes, using several metabolic (cell metabolism) and morphologic (structure) endpoints.Not only is this an important predictive test that, it is also a unique tool that can help to identify newer and better drugs, evaluate promising drug combinations, and serve as a \"gold standard\" correlative model with which to develop new DNA, RNA, and protein-based tests that better predict for drug activity.9. I and Ms Yue, my afflicted beloved, would give anything to take such a risk. In China it is barely possible to get Herceptin and if you can it is beyond reach financially.HER2 seems to be the smoldering ashes without a glow that only needs a good immunological ill wind to burst explode into flames. I suffered Officer Candidate, Airborne, and Bomb Disposal Training in the Military. I hoped at the time that putting myself in harm\\'s way would serve some greater good--ya, I really did. Herceptin treatment is no different: Roche has a promising, but imperfect drug. It saves lives while taking some in the process. I would volunteer, if I could, to take the medicine for me and for the greater good that would come of my success or failure. Ms Yue feels the same. The women here are not briefed on how to reduce the swelling caused by lymphedema and compression bandages, believe it or not, are too costly to just hand out. It is a battle we would love to fight in. Best, and good luck from China. ',\n",
       " 'I love it when I find research coming straight from the halls of the very hospital where I received my breast cancer treatment. It reminds me that I\\'m in good hands, that University of Florida researchers are on the cusp of breaking through the mysteries of cancer, that I may one day be the lucky recipient of cutting-edge discoveries, like this:University of Florida researchers report in a paper to be published in the August issue of Stem Cells that bone marrow stem cells attracted to the site of cancerous growths often take on the appearance of the malignant cells surrounding them. While these cells look like cancer, though, they may not act like cancer. They have the same skin, says lead study author Dr. Chris Cogle. But the question is: do they have the same guts?\"Our results indicate these cells act as developmental mimics; they come in and look like the surrounding neoplastic tissue, but they aren\\'t actually the seed of cancer,\" said Cogle who is affiliated with the cancer center I\\'ve called home for more than two years.\"At the worst, these cells could help support cancerous tissue by providing it with growth factors or proteins that help the cancer grow and survive. At the very least, these marrow cells are just being tricked into coming into the cancerous environment and then made to walk and talk like they don\\'t usually do.\"This phenomenon has been termed developmental mimicry and it could have implications for the integrity of the cell lines scientists use to test new cancer drugs.Up to five percent of cancerous tissue contains marrow-derived cells that look just like surrounding cancer. So when malignant tissue is grown in experiments that test the effects of new drugs, it\\'s possible the results are inaccurate. As a result, drugs may be targeting the marrow cell mimics, not actual cancer cells.Researchers are collaborating with scientists at other institutions as they strive to further understand this issue.

Lace front wigs are made of real human hair, are light and very comfortable. Unfortunately lace front wigs not that well known yet in Australia.I am specializing in making lace front wigs. It is made by hand and is undetectable. Please see the attached pictures. The scalp can breathe as each hair is carefully hand knotted on a lace. My product has been very successful but selling them to retailers I have noticed they sell it for a very high price. And not every body that would like it can afford it. This is why I would like to be put directly in touch with the person that needs my services. For my products to be accessible and not out of price.Please let me know how I can do this.I live between china and Australia. China because as my company is there and the factories a work with are too. I have the residential permit in Australia too. I am French and my partner in life is Australian. His dad passed away because of cancer so I do know what people with cancer go through.If you think my idea is interesting please let\\'s chair some ideas about this project.on ncoutti@hotmail.comRegardsNathalie coutti',\n",
       " \"It happened Saturday -- the third annual Yard Sale for the Cure. It took place in thousands of lawns all over Canada, and profits donated from the respective sales will benefit breast cancer charities. And it all started because of one breast cancer survivor's cluttered basement.Rachael Smith, diagnosed with breast cancer in April 2004 and in treatment for the nine months that followed, noticed before cancer that piles of stuff were gathering in the basement of the house she shared with her husband and two young daughters. A sale was in order, she realized, but then cancer arrived and a yard sale fell off her radar. And then she emerged from surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation and realized she had reason to give back to the community that helped her survive.And so Yard Sale for the Cure was born.Smith and a group of close friends worked tirelessly to make the first event a reality -- and a success. A year later, they did it again, and their success multiplied. There were 1,200 registered yard sales in 28 communities, and 100 percent of every dollar donated went directly to one of 10 recipient charities. More than $100,000 was raised, and the event generated $3,200,000 worth of media exposure. I can't wait to hear how this year's event went, once the dust settles and Smith and her volunteers begin to reflect on the fruits of their selfless labor.

       " 'I have a rough patch of skin on the bridge of my nose. It\\'s been there for some time -- how much time, I really don\\'t know -- and I am aware of it every day when I look in the mirror. I wash it, coat make-up on top of it, and sometimes pick at it and watch the flaky skin disappear. It always comes back, and then I study it, wash it, cover it all over again.It\\'s Skin Cancer Awareness Month and so I\\'ve been thinking more about this spot than usual, wondering if it could be more than just a spot. I even went so far as mentioning it to a medical student I saw a week ago during a breast cancer follow-up visit. But the inquiry never made it to my doctor and I\\'ve since let it drop.I\\'m never sure just how to handle medical issues like these. Typically, I\\'m hyper-sensitive and worry about all that could be going wrong with my body. Sometimes, I am able to cope normally, realizing most everything is probably nothing. That\\' the route I took this time. Yet now, now that I\\'ve talked to my mom who had a basal cell skin cancer removed from her face years ago -- the kind that flakes away and then comes back -- I\\'m becoming convinced, pretty sure anyway, that this could be worse than I\\'ve imagined it to be.Could the calm, peaceful, relaxed approach I so want for my life be the very thing that helps me delay a cancer diagnosis? Should I go back to panic mode every time something mysterious surfaces? I haven\\'t quite figured it out yet. I have figured out this much: I\\'m calling my dermatologist today.

       " \"Blogger Jen Creer recently shared with us that Funky Winkerbean creator Tom Batiuk is weaving a breast cancer storyline into his comic strip. It seems he's not alone in his creative endeavor. The website MyBreastCancerNetwork is also pairing cancer and comics -- but with a twist. These strips are personal. You get to be the subject. Just tell your story -- you can be the patient, the survivor, the loved one -- and illustrator Dash Shaw will craft your journey into a breast cancer comic strip to be featured on this site.PJ Hamel, MyBreastCancerNetwork expert patient and author, was the first to have her story documented in this fashion, five years after she did battle with the disease. Here's just one excerpt of her journey, as told in her words and Shaw's illustrations.Stamina, Neuropathy and My FeetMy feet were a painful reminder of the neuropathy that sometimes follows chemo. And I seemed to have lost every bit of stamina I'd ever had; 30 minutes on the treadmill left me sweating and panting, where before I'd scarcely noticed my legs were moving. Oh well, I thought; time heals. I have to be patient.A year later, I felt better, but not nearly as good as I'd hoped. Gradually, through regular trips to the gym, my stamina was improving. I hadn't yet worked up to the heavy weights I'd been lifting before cancer, but month by month, I was lifting a bit more. My feet still hurt; and every morning I'd find myself raked with scratch marks, evidence of an itch in my chest that just wouldn't quit. My shoulder was getting worse, as I put off dealing with the ache. OK, I thought; give it time.

       " 'That\\'s Fit blogger Jonathon Morgan wrote on May 25 about five sunscreen myths. In the spirit of Skin Cancer Awareness Month, it seems appropriate to mention this thought-provoking news here on this site.I just heard a radio commercial about a certain sunscreen, claiming the product is so good consumers need only apply the lotion one time during an eight-hour time frame. It seems, according to the following list of myths, this is not exactly true.Myth #1: Sunscreens protect all day.Fact: Regardless of the SPF or what the label says, sunscreens must be reapplied every two hours because active ingredients in most products break down when exposed to the sun.Myth #2: Some sunscreens are waterproof.Fact: The FDA does not use the word \"waterproof.\" Nor should we. Now \"water/sweat/perspiration resistant\" is accurate but this only means the sunscreen offers SPF protection after 40 minutes of water exposure. Add \"very\" to this string of words and you get 80 minutes of protection.Myth #3: Sunscreen can provide total sunblock.Fact: Nope. No sunscreen blocks 100 percent of UV rays. SPF 15 protects against 93 percent, though. SPF 30 protects against 97 percent. SPF 50 shuts out 98 percent. But this only really works when you apply two tablespoons on your body 30 minutes before going outside so the sunscreen has time to absorb into your skin.Myth #4: Sunscreen is all you need to stay safe.Fact: Sunscreen is only one piece of the puzzle. Other pieces include seeking shade between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, covering up with clothing, wearing broad-brimmed hats and UV-blocking sunglasses, completing self-exams, and reporting for annual professional skin evaluations.Myth #5: SPF measures levels of protection for UVB and UVA rays.Fact: SPF really only measures for UVB rays. Yet some of the 16 active ingredients in sunscreens block or absorb some UVA rays. Look for products labeled \"broad spectrum\" for the most protection.

       " \"I told my little guy Danny today that he and his big brother would be going to their Nana's house so I could go to the doctor -- for an echo-cardiogram to test for possible heart damage due to Herceptin therapy for breast cancer. Danny -- age three -- asked me, Why you keep doing that? This is the same question he keeps asking -- because he wants to know why I keep going to the doctor. I give him the same answer each time -- that I need to keeping seeing doctors so I can stay healthy. He always seems satisfied with this response, although he continues to ask the same question. He either forgets that he's already asked or he forgets my response or he finds comfort in my routine answer -- or perhaps he is completely aware of his repeat question and just wants me to provide a better explanation. Which is hard to do -- in a three-year-old kind of way -- when my response is the best I've got. I keep going to the doctor in search of health. It's simple. And fortunately, so is Danny -- simple in a young and innocent and pure way. And Joey is too.Right after my exchange with Danny, Joey -- age five -- said to me, Won't you be glad when you don't need to go to the doctor and you can be healthy all by yourself? Yep, I told him and then realized that these boys have a definite pulse on my cancer journey -- almost two years after it started. They wonder about it and try to figure it out and predict how I must feel. And through it all, I am happy they are involved with me in this intricate adventure. And I am concerned at the same time that what they do know may cause them some stress, some worry, some uncertainty about our future together. My hope is that this experience in their young lives strengthens them, humbles them, prepares them for a future that is not always as simple as the responses I give them about an illness that is so complex. But when it comes down to really simple terms -- that we all can appreciate -- I have my boys and they have me and for today, that is all that matters. Well, that and the fact that my echo-cardiogram today revealed that my heart is just fine. Comments: \",\n",

Her back hurts, she said, and her stomach hurts and she is having difficulty breathing. Still her message is loud and clear: she is not giving up.When doctors told her there was nothing more they could do, Tammy Faye, 65, said she felt sorry for herself for about one minute.

       " 'I wrote on May 29 about my worry regarding a dry, flaky patch of skin on my nose. Unsure of the status of this unusual spot, I immediately called my dermatologist and made an appointment -- which did not end up being all that immediate. The earliest slot available for addressing my personal crisis was June 12 at 11 AM. I took it. And then the stars aligned and I got a call on this very same day.\"We have a cancellation tomorrow. Do you want to come in then?\" said the voice on the other end of the phone. Yes, yes, yes, I wanted it. And so I took this slot instead.Yesterday I met with my dermatologist. The good news is: what I found on the bridge of my nose is not cancer. The bad news is: it was trying really hard to become cancer.What I had belongs to a family called Actinic Keratoses (AKs). Considered the earliest stage in the development of cancer, AKs are common growths of the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis). They are caused by long-term exposure to the sun, dating back as far as childhood. The condition typically appears after age 40 but in geographic areas with year-round, high-intensity sunlight like Florida -- where I currently live and where most of my past tanning pursuits occurred -- AKs can show up in the teens and 20s. Half of all older, fair-skinned -- me -- people who live in hot, sunny areas will develop AKs.AKs are pre-cancerous, and so mine was caught early and obliterated by a procedure called cryosurgery. The area was essentially frozen and while it looks fine now, it will likely take the form of a blister over the next few days. Then it will heal and fade. A light scar may linger.There are other methods for treating AKs, depending on the magnitude of each person\\'s lesion. Surgical removal, topical chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, chemical peeling, and laser skin resurfacing are often options.The only way to prevent AKs is to prevent sun exposure. And while it\\'s never too late to implement sun-safe practices in our lives, it is too late for most of us who have already done damage to our skin to go back to the drawing board. We can serve as key players in the game of prevention, though, by initiating prevention for our children who can be saved by our hard lessons.

Still, it hasn't taken away my ability to witness first-hand the miracle of childbirth, to hold a brand new baby in my arms, to lose myself in the wonder of an innocent and unburdened life.Yesterday, my sister had her second baby girl. I was there -- from morning until evening, while she labored for 12 hours and then delivered a perfect, pink, precious bundle of hope. The whole journey made me cry. I cried for the sheer pleasure of being in the room for such a special occasion, for holding my sister's numb and heavy leg in the correct position, for watching a baby plunge into the world, for cutting the umbilical cord. I cried for the pain my sister endured, for the joy of new beginnings, for all that comes next.For a moment while I held my new niece, I longed for my own baby. Then thoughts of cancer flooded my mind -- combined with thoughts of sleepless nights and endless shrieks and temper tantrums -- and I realized I am happy just as I am, with my own two little boys and a sweet baby girl I plan to borrow as much as possible.Welcome to the world, Tori!

       " 'Do you have less energy than you did before cancer? Do you sometimes crash in the middle of the afternoon? If you answered Yes to these questions and wonder why your energy is zapped, you may want to consider something completely outside the realm of cancer. Like your diet.Canyon Ranch nutritionists say lack of energy is not always related to diet. It can also stem from lack of sleep and exercise, depression, anxiety, low-grade infection, medication, reaction to alcohol, and caffeine withdrawal or dependence. But diet surely plays a part, and sometimes a very large part. So in the interest of energetic and healthy living, you might want to give some thought to these energy-building diet tips.Start the day with a healthy breakfast. When kids don\\'t eat breakfast, they don\\'t think as clearly and don\\'t do homework as well as their well-nourished classmates. Adults are no different. Everyone needs a jump-start in the morning. It\\'s good for metabolism and blood sugar. It\\'s good for the brain.Eat every three to four hours. Blood sugar levels are at their lowest about four hours after a meal. Low blood sugar = low energy so to keep your motor running, eat breakfast, lunch, an afternoon snack, and dinner. Some people prefer a mid-morning snack too. Don\\'t undereat. Overeating leads to weight gain. But undereating doesn\\'t lead to long-term weight loss. It leads to low energy. So keep eating -- just make it healthy.Eat balanced meals and snacks. Make sure protein, and even a little healthy fat, accompany any other foods you eat. These two items slow digestion and absorbption of carbohydrates, leaving us with a longer-lasting supply of blood sugar, a controlled hunger, and sustained energy. Good sources of protein include: low-fat cheese, eggs or egg whites, fresh fish, nuts and seeds, nut butters, beans, soy, chicken and turkey, and canned tuna or salmon.Eat mindfully. Don\\'t just eat. Pay attention to your appetite and hunger. Eat on a schedule -- but only until your hunger is satisfied. This way, you\\'ll never end up with that starving feeling.Thanks again, Canyon Ranch experts, for your continued wisdom. Comments: <STRONG>Eat every three to four hours.

Some people prefer a mid-morning snack too. <STRONG>Don\\'t undereat. Overeating leads to weight gain. But undereating doesn\\'t lead to long-term weight loss. It leads to low energy. So keep eating -- just make it healthy.<STRONG>Eat balanced meals and snacks. Make sure protein, and even a little healthy fat, accompany any other foods you eat. These two items slow digestion and absorbption of carbohydrates, leaving us with a longer-lasting supply of blood sugar, a controlled hunger, and sustained energy. Good sources of protein include: low-fat cheese, eggs or egg whites, fresh fish, nuts and seeds, nut butters, beans, soy, chicken and turkey, and canned tuna or salmon.<STRONG>Eat mindfully.

       " 'Four more breast cancer genes have been uncovered by a team of international scientists, a discovery that may rival in importance the cloning of the BRCA2 gene in 1995. Scientists say women with mutated versions of these genes have a pretty low risk of contracting breast cancer, though, and it\\'s unlikely that screening tests for such mutations will be developed.Genetic causes of breast cancer account for 5 to 10 percent of all cases. Lifestyle factors, such as smoking and environmental influences, account for the rest. Until now, only 25 percent of the genes suspected to cause inherited breast cancer had been identified. The four new genes -- FRFR2, TNRC9, MAP3K1, and LSP1 -- are believed to be fairly common yet account for only four percent of all cases. The genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, in contrast, are not very common but indicate a high risk for disease.There are probably 100 to 200 more genes yet to be found that contribute to breast cancer risk. Researchers are merely scratching the surface. Studies like this one -- scientists found the four genes while sifting through the DNA of 50,000 women -- will give experts a good idea of where to look for others.

       " \"I'm still on a quest for guidance on the whole fish topic. The same few questions keep cycling through my head. How often should I eat fish? What kind of fish should I eat? What are the real health dangers surrounding fish consumption? I keep searching for answers. And now and then, I catch some good advice about the topic. If you find yourself floundering at times, like me, here are seven tips you might find helpful.   The National Academy of   Sciences, the American   Heart Association, and the World Health   Organization all encourage regular fish consumption. Sure, there are   legitimate concerns about environmental issues, but experts still say the   benefits of eating a variety of fish far outweigh the risks. Eating fish   protects the heart and reduces the risk for Alzheimer's disease, arthritis,   strokes, depression, bipolar disorder, and our favorite topic here at this   site: cancer.   Mercury -- a toxic substance found in some fish and known to contribute to   cancer and other health issues -- has scared me time and time again. But just   recently, I think I've figured out how to manage this worry. According to the   EPA and FDA, the safe limit for mercury consumption is   12 ounces of low mercury fish per week.   Low mercury fish include but are not limited to: Anchovies, Catfish,   Clams, Cod, Crab, Crawfish, Flounder, Lobster (spiny, Maine), Mackerel   (Atlantic, Chub), Mahi Mahi, Mullet, Oysters, Salmon (canned, Alaskan),   Scallops, Shrimp, Tilapia, Trout (freshwater), Tuna (canned, light),   Whitefish, and Whiting. These are the fish we can eat   frequently.   Moderate mercury fish -- eat just six ounces per month --   include: Bass, Grouper, Halibut, Lobster (Northern/American), Mackerel   (Spanish), Marlin, Snapper, Tilefish (Atlantic), and Tuna (canned, Albacore,   Bigeye, Skipjack, Yellowfin). High mercury fish -- to be   avoided -- include: King Mackerel, Shark, Swordfish, Tilefish (Gulf   of Mexico), and Blue Fin Tuna.   Mercury is not the only fish contaminant. Fish can also be polluted with   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, polybrominated diphenyl esters   (PBDE), and more. These toxins collect in the fatty tissue of fish that   consumers end up eating. Plant eaters and fish lower on the food chain usually   have fewer of these toxins. Predators, such as Shark, Swordfish, and King   Mackerel, contain higher levels.   I continually must remind myself about this whole farm-raised vs. wild   salmon thing. OK, this is how it goes: Farmed salmon tends to be higher in PCB   levels than wild salmon. Levels are still within FDA safety limits but I think   I'll stick with the wild stuff myself. It also has higher proportions of omega   3 fats -- these are good for us.   When in doubt, it's wise to consult informational resources. These are   just a few: Seafood Choices   Alliance, Got Mercury?, and US FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied   Nutrition.  Comments: 1. To Ms. Donaldson and readers:As evidenced by the questions posed at the start of your blog, consumers are confused about the benefits of including seafood in their diets. As a nutrition professional with the National Fisheries Institute (NFI), I work to clear up this confusion by helping people understand the most current and authoritative recommendations for eating fish. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, American Heart Association, American Dietetic Association, and the American Institute for Cancer Research all recommend that people eat at least two servings of fish per week. Unfortunately, 80 percent of Americans are eating only about half of the seafood recommended for optimal health, and potentially missing out on the numerous health benefits such as reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, depression, and Alzheimerâ\\x80\\x99s disease. Part of the hesitation may be a misunderstanding of the federal guidelines. The guidelines exist only for women who are or might become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children. This special population is advised to still eat 12 ounces (or about two to four servings) of a variety of seafood each week, of which six ounces can be albacore tuna. There are only four fish that people in the special group should avoid -- shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tile fish. As far as contaminants are concerned, numerous scientific studies from institutions such as Harvard Medical School and The Institute of Medicine have weighed the benefits and risks of seafood consumption and the results are clear: The health benefits associated with eating fish â\\x80\\x93 farmed and wild alike â\\x80\\x93 far outweigh any potential risk from exposure to trace amounts of substances like mercury. Please visit the website www.aboutseafood.com for more information about eating seafood at least twice a week, including links to references and delicious recipes.

       " 'First, it seemed eating lycopene-rich tomatoes offered protection against prostate cancer. Now it seems this is not so true. In fact, researchers have found an association between an increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer and beta carotene, an antioxidant related to lycopene.Lycopene seemed for a short time to be a quick and easy fix for men trying to lower their prostate cancer risk. Yet studies are failing to show any significant differences in blood lycopene levels between men who develop the disease and those who do not.The largest study to yield these results investigated the role of blood levels of lycopene and other antioxidants in the prevention of prostate cancer. It was an unexpected turn of events that led researchers to the link between the most aggressive cancers and antioxidants found in many vegetables. While the observation may be due to chance, beta carotene is known to increase risk of lung cancer and heart disease in smokers and may be worth a bit more study.No one is suggesting people stop eating their veggies. Experts are cautioning against taking beta carotene supplements, however. Comments: No one is suggesting people stop eating their veggies. Experts are cautioning against taking beta carotene supplements, however.1. Though I linked to this study earlier last week,<A href=\"http://www.thecancerblog.com/2007/05/29/tomatoes-can-help-send-cancer-packing/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.thecancerblog.com/2007/05/29/tomatoes-can-help-send-cancer-packing/</A>primarily because the blogger, I felt, was not guarded enough in the analysis, I don\\'t believe we should throw out the baby with the bathwater because of this one study. An analysis of the study method is always warranted. The subjects enrolled in the current study were initially screened through a PSA test and digital rectal exam, and were then followed through routine exams and screenings until first occurrence of prostate cancer, death or the end of the trial in 2001. Is it possible that those who were at high risk for prostate cancer indicated by a high PSA count might take beta-carotene and or lycopene supplement in an effort to reduce the risk of the disease?â\\x80? If that is true, a higher risk might lead to consumption of high beta-carotene in the subjects, not vice versa.Another thing that needs to be considered is that the blood test for carotenoids was conducted only once at the beginning of the study. The data derived from the single test could not show the subjectsâ\\x80\\x99 dietary habits before nor after they enrolled in the study, This means that the results of the current study may not be applicable to people who use lycopene rich vegetables such as tomatoes or tomato based foods for a long period.<A href=\"http://foodconsumer.org/7777/8888/C_ancer_31/052106062007_Tomatoes_can_t_prevent_prostate_cancer.shtml\" rel=nofollow>http://foodconsumer.org/7777/8888/C_ancer_31/052106062007_Tomatoes_can_t_prevent_prostate_cancer.shtml</A>So, for me, it\\'s still up in the air. But, there are clear associations with other risk factors. I\\'d hate to see an overweight, sedentary, meat eater, take carotenoids to avoid prostate cancer.',\n",
       " 'A few days ago, my two little boys ended up with itchy, bumpy rashes on their necks, backs, and chests. \"Mommy, I\\'m itchy,\" they\\'d declare while scratching at their tender skin in search of relief. I did all I could to soothe my bothered boys. I lightly scratched their skin, soaked them in cool tubs of water, offered them Benadryl, and taught them how to gently pat their skin and not dig at it. Eventually, the itches went away -- thanks to the passage of time. And eventually, I learned that sunscreen was likely to blame for their skin irritations.My boys are four and six. Slowly over the years, I have abandoned baby sunscreens and have lathered them with the same sunscreens I use -- the potions made for adult skin. They didn\\'t seem like babies anymore so it seemed an appropriate transition. Most times, their skin fared well. This time, it did not.While at my skin cancer screening appointment the other day, my dermatologist gave me something to think about. She told me the primary ingredients in sunscreen for children should be zinc or titanium oxide -- found primarily in baby sunscreen products. So no more grown-up lotions for my boys. I am now the proud owner of New! Banana Boat Baby SPF 50 UVA &amp; UVB sunblock lotion. It\\'s tear-free, sting-free, as mild as water, and reportedly waterproof too -- although some experts maintain waterproof is not really possible in the world of sunscreen. Water resistant, maybe; waterproof, no. Most important, though, is one of the active ingredients in my new tube of protective lotion: Titanium Dioxide. Comments: 1. sunessencesuncreen.com also has a baby sunblock made from these same ingredients and is also dermatologist recommended.',\n",
       " \"I woke yesterday morning to voices on the Today Show telling me that the use of hair dye is linked to incidences of lymphoma -- a general term for a group of cancers that originate in the lymphatic system. I know I've heard in the past about the possible link between cancer and the chemicals that add color to hair -- but the connection has never been revealed as very strong and the topic did not ever apply to me so I filed the information in the back of my mind. But now, it appears the link may be stronger than originally thought -- and I recently dyed my own post-chemo brown hair -- so I listened more intently this time and learned about the study that implies that touching up my roots may not be a wise practice.The results of a European study, appearing in the July 1 issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology, reveal that roughly 10 percent of lymphomas in women could be caused by the use of hair dyes. The data suggest a small increase in risk -- and clearly more research is necessary -- but what researchers have found is that for the women who have dyed their hair more than 12 times, the risk is highest. And those who colored their locks before 1980 have the greatest risk. Since 1980, chemicals thought to be cancer-causing were eliminated from dyes -- although it is still not definite whether or not current hair dyes are risk-free. It is definite, say researchers, that further study of this topic is important. In the meantime, I think I will let my artificial reddish chestnut hues fade away while I enjoy the plain brown hair that covers my once-bald scalp.  Comments: 1. Hey Guy,Men use hair dye a lot more than women. We have such short hair that it becomes necessary for a man with a crew cut to dye the new crop of hair twice per month.\",\n",
       " \"New cancer drug Torisol was approved on Wednesday by the FDA for use with renal cell carcinoma, an advanced form of kidney cancer.Torisol, also known as temsirolimus, is an enzyme inhibitor made by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and has shown promise for prolonging patient survival. It's the third kidney cancer drug approved in the past 18 months -- the other two are Nexavar, intended to delay disease progression, and Sutent, for tumor size reduction.Many kidney cancer patients are cured by surgery. About 35 percent of patients, however, experience a recurrence or a spread of the disease. Until just recently, there were no effective drugs to control these issues. Now there are several -- and Torisol is the one showing modest improvement in survival for patients with the most advanced tumors. Further study will indicate whether or not the drug is useful for patients with less extensive metastatic disease. Comments: 1. Finally, a site with the facts. Toriesel, as I understand it, is for people with very advanced kidney cancer who are looking for months, not years. I see that many sites and message boards are holding out to be something entirely different and many who are just tired of the SEs from Sutent and Nexavar looking for relief and, maybe this one will do it. But from what I read it is much more last stand than anything else and not a replacement for sutent or Nexavar. Am I wrong?David Fosterwww.mpablog.typepad.com/david_foster\",\n",

This left-handed conclusion, published in the journal Epidemiology, comes from the study of 12,000 women in the Netherlands whose medical histories were followed for 13 years.

Having successfully dodged a number of disorders, I doubt that my left hand is prematurely pulling me toward my grave.\"1. Infants who are born left-handed may well have been exposed to higher levels of sex hormones in the womb that can also cause changes in breast tissue. Pre-natal hormones have a profound effect on us. For example, homosexual women tend to be more left-handed as well. We already know that prenatal neuroendocrine levels are a factor in the development of human sexual orientation and there has been evidence that pre-natal hormones affect functional brain asymmetries. So hormones in utero have a profound effect on sexuality, brain characteristics, and could therefore affect cancer risk.',\n",

       " 'In today\\'s world, we worry about carbohydrates. We monitor them, count them, obsess about them, and pare them down to just about nothing in order to lose weight. Yet, quality carbs have a fierce power in the fight against disease. They are packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. They absorb slowly and stabilize blood sugar, appetite, even mood. Carbs don\\'t have to be avoided. In fact, they should be embraced -- in their most healthy forms.While at the Canyon Ranch resort in Tucson this past April, I observed that all meals are balanced with small-to-moderate portion sizes of carbohydrate foods. Canyon Ranch is all about health and healing. If the experts here say carbs can be good for us, I believe them. The key to carb management is knowing which ones keep cancer and other disease at bay. It\\'s simple, really.

       " 'My brother-in-law came up to me tonight with his iPod and handed me his headsets. A cue to put them on, I guessed -- and so I did. A song played and right away I liked what I heard. It was the exact type of music I like -- with a grungy, rock kind of sound. I figured Jack knows what I like and was sharing a new song with me. Which he was -- but there was something more to it. It wasn\\'t just a good song -- it was a good song about cancer, with a message of hope and strength and living through the struggles of a life that has been shaken. Written by Scott Leger of the Austin-based band wideawake, Maybe Tonight, Maybe Tomorrow is dedicated to the millions of people affected by cancer -- those who have lost, those who have survived, those who fight and volunteer and support and research and raise awareness and give and inspire. And for those without cancer too really. For anyone who is faced with forces that threaten the most precious of assets -- time.Inspired by a friend\\'s cancer diagnosis, Leger wrote the song and debuted it on May 19 at the LIVESTRONG Gala. It is now available though iTunes for 99 cents -- and 100 percent of the funds from the sale of the song benefit the Lance Armstrong Foundation. Leger writes in a journal on his website that he wrote this song to capture the human desire to overcome and to survive. And that he does. I heard the news today. It came out of nowhere.I wish I could run away,but where would I go?Is this my destiny? Something so unfair... What will become of me?God only knows.And they say the road to heaven might lead us back through hell.Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow, we will win this fight and bury this sorrow.We\\'re so alive, still holding on, not ready to die, so we LIVESTRONG.My pride is left for dead, as my world gets shaken.The thoughts inside my head are so hard to control.I am staring down the unknown, but one thing is certain.You could break my body, but you will never break my soul.And they say the road to heaven might leads us back through hell, but we\\'re holding on for morethan stories to tell.Maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow, we will win this fight and bury this sorrow.We\\'re so alive, still holding on, not ready to die, so we LIVESTRONG. Comments: 1. I just bought this song from itunes and I loved it! I think its the type of song that anyone would like because it\\'s so uplifting.

Jacki,Thank you for bringing awareness to this disease. Sarah is a member (family really) of the MPIP Bulletin Board (mpip.org). It\\'s a board for melanoma patients and family members to exchange information, resources, and support. Many of us are readers of Sarah\\'s blog and are so saddened by her recent decline. The majority of melanomas present themselves as a visible change on the skin (a changing mole or freckle). How many DEADLY cancers can you SEE with your eyes? If breast cancer, ovarian cancer, testicular cancer, etc.. presented themselves as a visible change on the outside of our skin where we could see it... well we would probably be scouring our bodies every month. Thank you again.Melissa2. Unfortunately, heart-breaking stories like Sarah\\'s are not so uncommon. Melanoma used to be a rare cancer but now someone dies from melanoma every hour. My daughter Jaime\\'s hour was 1PM on March 16, 2007. She will forever be 29 years old, having first been diagnosed with melanoma at age 20. But it is important that we learn from these courageous melanoma warriors who lose the battle and that we continue to fight for a cure -- or even a treatment that will manage the disease -- and promote awareness. My heart goes out to Sarah\\'s family because I know the dark and painful path they will be on in the near future and I am so sorry.3. It is good to bring awareness of Melanoma to as many as possible. My husband and I knew about the dangers of the sun here in Australia but he did not know about it as a young person. My husband fought for 3 years and passed away on April 20 2007 from this deadly cancer. It seems there is no cure only sometimes more time can be bought by drugs but not in our case. I found MPIP to be a real blessing at the time that I needed information and support.Jennifer4. Sarah passed away this morning. ',\n",

I want you to stay out of the sun, cover up, dress yourself in sunscreen, report for annual skin cancer screenings, and arm yourself with knowledge.

       " 'I\\'m writing today to share with you a victory -- a diet and exercise victory. Let me begin with a little background.I\\'ve always been in the normal weight range for my height. I am about 5\\'7\" and prior to each of my two pregnancies, I weighed 142. For me, that translates into size eight clothing, size six for some oddly made-garments. I\\'ve always been generally happy with my weight, and I\\'ve never obsessed about the numbers on the scale. Yet there\\'s been one area that\\'s bothered me ever since my first baby was born -- my tummy. Now I like to use the excuse that my babies were big -- 10 pounds, nine ounces and 10 pounds, two ounces -- but clinging to this explanation did nothing to remove the loose skin from my middle. And for years, I guess I wasn\\'t ready to work at whittling it away.Enter cancer. Research shows many breast cancer patients gain weight during treatment -- sometimes up to 30 pounds. And while I never did gain this much, my weight has increased over the past almost three years. Perhaps it was hormones, the chemotherapy drugs, the anti-depressant I just stopped taking. Regardless, I didn\\'t like the extra weight. So I tried to do something about it -- and about that pesky tummy too. And herein lies the victory.Just two months ago, I weighed 150. Then I cut out soda, sweets, foods high in sugar, and foods high in fat. I began eating healthy meals, healthy snacks, and more fruit than usual. I learned how to eat to fill my stomach, not stuff it. And I continued exercising like I\\'ve always done, several times per week.Today, I stood on the scale at my local grocery store and watched this number flash before my eyes: 142. And when I walked the aisles of the store, picking up my fruit, veggies, fish, chicken, and low-fat cheese, I noticed all the items I would have normally thrown in my cart -- potato chips, cereals, candy, junk. This stuff is loaded with sugar and fat. It feels good to be rid of it. And it feels good to be slimmer, more fit, and most important, healthier.It may have been the breast cancer that contributed to my extra pounds. But I suspect it was also my diet. This suspicion leads me to encourage you to make a few healthy changes in your own eating habits. And then witness the victory of positive change. Comments: Just two months ago, I weighed 150.

Exercise SecretsFor every pound you want to lose, you have to cut back 3500 calories or expend 3500 calories worth of energy above your normal activity. Exercising is the answer. You can lose weight minus the deprivation and research has proven those who exercised peeled an average of six pounds a year. So get active!When you exercise make sure you always eat 3-4 hours before. Your best choice is a high-carbohydrate, low-fat meal, with foods like breakfast cereal, fruit, yogurt, fruit juice, bread, pasta and rice. Doing both aerobics and weight training is the optimal way to lose more fat and gain more muscle. Be creative with your exercise routine. You can use exercise equipment in combination with you own body for the best results. Here are two wonder works for a sculpted body. The squat is an excellent compound exercise and it really works the quadriceps, hamstrings and glutes. The bench press works multiple muscles at once. It works the chest, the shoulders and the triceps. Oh yeah, smile; it does the facial muscles wonders as well as your attitude while exercising. Click link below for secret additional exercises for a body that will turn heads.<A href=\"http://naturalsupply.blogspot.com/2007/06/exercise-to-lose-weight.html\" rel=nofollow>http://naturalsupply.blogspot.com/2007/06/exercise-to-lose-weight.html</A>2. I had the same problem. I am the same height as you as weighed 133 on the day of surgery for my mastectomy. I LOST 5 pounds during chemo (I think it was more muscle weight), and about 6 months after the completion of theraphy I started to put on weight slowly. Now mind you I was a dancer with low bodyfat. I did 60 boy push-ups 3x a week! I was in super shape \"before.\" It\\'s hard when someone such as myself who was super fit have their hormones drop to nothing and even a simple meal becomes something scary. On December 21st I weighed in at 147 pounds and I cried to my doctor not believing my eyes. On December 22nd I joined a gym and now I work out faithfully 5x a week HARD. You have to. You have to do cardio and lift weights. You have to force a metabolism on your body since the metabolism we had is no longer. After six months I now weight 141 and I am maintaing that weight. But it\\'s a constant struggle. It depresses me sometimes because I workout like I\\'m training for a race or competition. But in reality, I\\'m competing for my life and keeping off the fat is extremely important. Remember, nothing comes easy. Work hard, eat well and get enough sleep. I feel so much better about myself now and I have tons of energy. ',\n",

Their mothers became fast friends, worked together on a neighborhood garage sale, and invited the little girls to set up a lemonade stand. The idea came from the story of another little girl, diagnosed with cancer just before her first birthday, who at age four opened her own stand with the goal of raising $1 million for her hospital. Only days before she died did she realize she would reach her goal.How did Emily and Lily do? The totals are not yet in -- but they did raise $70 right away on the first day of the sale.

He was 89.Mr. Wizard's target audience was kids (baby boomers: you may already know this) and his lessons taught youngsters to use the thinking skills of scientists through workshop experiments using simple household items. His 1950s series Watch Mr. Wizard was so good it won a Peabody Award in 1954, and Herbert was one of David Letterman' first guests when the show Late Night With David Letterman debuted in 1982. Herbert's show made it to Nickelodeon too and ran from 1983 to 1991. Reruns were shown until 2000. Nickelodeon's Mr. Wizard episodes are available here.A native of Waconia, Minnesota, Herbert graduated from LaCrosse State Teachers College in 1940; served as a U.S. Army Air Corps pilot during World War II; and worked as an actor, model, and radio writer before reaching fame on Mr. Wizard in Chicago -- and then New York -- on NBC.He is survived by six children and stepchildren and by his second wife, Norma. Comments: 1. Back in his day, he was huge on television. Yes, I dare say that most Boomers do remember watching him. It was such a fascinating show. None of the other science shows for kids over the past twenty years had the viewership or the impact as he had. Maybe it was that the virtual numbers of babies born between 1946 and 1964 was unprecedented in America? Either way, Rest In Peace Mr. Wizard!\",\n",
       " \"Michael Fumento is an author, journalist, and attorney specializing in science and health issues. And he has a lot to say about the Surgeon General's recent announcement that the second-hand smoke debate is over -- that second-hand smoke does in fact kill. Fumento believes that the debate is over means if you have your doubts, then keep them to yourself -- that the topic is not up for discussion any longer. But Fumento states that we should definitely have doubts -- about the effects of second-hand smoke and about what the Surgeon General has to say about it.The report by the Surgeon General is apparently based on findings that already existed -- no new science or research supports the foundation of this dramatic new -- and extremely long -- report on what has already been studied. The first borrowed-from study by the EPA came about in 1993 and Fumento says that it has as many holes in it as a spaghetti strainer. One such hole involves manipulating statistics to guarantee the intended result by sheer luck of the draw. Then came several more meta-analysis studies that are largely flawed. Fumento does not argue with urging smokers to stop smoking and reducing the onset of teen smoking and minimizing the annoyance of second-hand smoke. What he does say is this -- inventing scientific outcomes and shutting down scientific debate is intolerable. Especially when back in 1975, a New England Journal of Medicine study revealed that even when smoke is blown directly in someone's face, the concentration is equal to 04 cigarettes an hour or 0.1 cigarettes a day. Not quite the same as smoking two packs a day. And not probable that this would cause the number of deaths the Surgeon General reports. Fumento says this -- The purpose of the passive smoking campaign has never been to protect non-smokers. Instead, it is to cow smokers into giving up the habit, expand bureaucratic turf, and fatten agency and pressure group coffers. So is this debate a matter or opinion or a matter of science? Read on. Check the facts. Think about it. And detemine where you stand on this hot topic. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'It was a Canyon Ranch nutritionist, not a fitness trainer, who shared with me these words of wisdom regarding exercise. I consider this more evidence backing the fact that diet and exercise go hand in hand, that each one cannot fully and successfully operate in isolation from the other.So here it is, this Saturday\\'s Worthy Wisdom:After we exercise, we should eat something within 15 minutes of completing our physical challenge. Why? Because we\\'ve taxed our bodies, depleted them, and it\\'s important to put something back in after taking so much out. Consider a banana, a handful of nuts, something nutritious and energizing, and allow your body to recover. And don\\'t forget about water -- drink plenty to re-hydrate yourself.Life is all about replenishing. Take cancer. It invades our bodies, compromises it in endless ways, and leaves us weak and tired. Yet when, and if, it retreats, we get the chance to spring back to life. Through physical and emotional nourishment, we put back in what cancer took out. Exercise works the same way.Take something out, put something back. Repeat this to yourself over and over again -- and make it a way of life.Thanks Canyon Ranch for this Worthy Wisdom.

My family doc, the proverbial marathon runner, is always first to point out about hyponatremia in his running lectures. Hyponatremia, an electrolyte disturbance, can exist in humans when the sodium concentration in the plasma falls below 135mmol/L. At lower levels, water intoxication may occur, and this can be very dangerous. Lost sweat (salt and water) is replaced by ingested water (no salt). This dilutes the sodium in the bloodstream and hyponatremia results. Long-distance racers carry a greater risk of hyponatremia, but it can happen in casual three-mile runners. Here\\'s a good write-up about it from SportsMed Web.<A href=\"http://www.rice.edu/~jenky/sports/salt.html\" rel=nofollow>http://www.rice.edu/~jenky/sports/salt.html</A>2. The article you link to indicates there\\'s no risk for hyponatremia for exercise under 1 hour. \"Casual three-mile\" running taking more than 1 hour? Causing hyponatremia? I would call a three mile run in 60 minutes a \"walk.\" And I can\\'t see it causing hyponatremia unless one is a massive sweater.Drink water. It\\'s cheap and we Americans get way too much sodium in the diet.3.

       " 'It\\'s Father\\'s Day. And all dads out there deserve a pat on the back, a sincere thank you, a celebration in their honor. But there\\'s one group of dads to whom I\\'m giving special attention on this fine Sunday, June 17 -- dads with cancer.Having been a mom with cancer, I know how parenting becomes doubly difficult when a life-threatening illness crowds into the picture. The usual mommy and daddy responsibilities are hard enough on their own. Add cancer and all sense of balance, control, and even joy can fly out the window.Holding down the daddy fort while battling and surviving cancer is no small task. So let\\'s honor some of the dads who manage this feat. Here are seven of them.Tony SnowHe has two daughters and one son, a powerful job -- he\\'s the White House Press Secretary -- and a cancer that just recently surfaced for a second time. First diagnosed in 2005 with colon cancer, Snow learned in March that an abdominal growth was cancer. And it had metastasized. He took a short time off from work but returned on April 30. He\\'s back in the swing of things -- and is hopefully enjoying his Father\\'s Day.Lance ArmstrongWe associate yellow with this cycling dad of three -- he has one son and twin daughters. Think yellow biking jerseys, yellow bracelets, yellow banners featured on his Lance Armstrong Foundation website. It\\'s a vibrant color fit for a man who annihilated cancer that traveled his body and by some accounts, should have killed him. It didn\\'t, though. Let\\'s hope this go-getter allows himself a bit of rest on this Dad\\'s Day.Steve JobsHe\\'s the CEO and co-founder of Apple, dad of four, and survivor of one of the deadliest forms of cancer -- pancreatic cancer. His health today is described as robust. Here\\'s to a robust Father\\'s Day!Barry WatsonA young actor, husband, and father of one, this dad has been surviving Hodgkins Lymphoma since 2002. You may know him as Matt Camden on the long-running television series Seventh Heaven or as Brian on this year\\'s What About Brian. What you might not know is that Watson, in remission since 2003, is a fairly new dad. His son, Oliver, was born in May 2005. Happy second Father\\'s Day.Not all cancer dads are celebrities. In fact, most are dads whose diseases are not spotlighted for public interest. Here are a few of my everyday cancer dads.My breast cancer surgeonThe man who removed my breast cancer tumor, the kind soul who responds every time I pipe up with a new worry, the dad and grandfather, is also battling cancer -- prostate cancer. He describes it as treatable. It was picked up on routine screening -- kind of like a mammogram, he told me -- and was found quickly and treated swiftly. He left town for a time to receive a cutting edge radiation therapy and is now back saving more women from breast cancer. His kids should be proud. So should he.The dad of the mom I met at Joey\\'s schoolIn April, I met a mom while waiting to pick up my six-year-old from kindergarten. She shared that her father was undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, and we talked, swapped cancer stories, and then went our separate ways. I know nothing more about this dad yet I think of him often, hoping his treatment is going well, hoping his daughter finds peace as she witnesses the decline of a parent. May they have a treasured Father\\'s Day together.TomTom is a family friend -- a dad of two girls and grandfather of four -- who has battled cancer time and time again. Just as sure as his disease keeps coming back, he keeps fighting. This dad has outlived most of his prognoses, and is still living strong. He is proof that power of mind and attitude are real forces in the fight against cancer. I suspect he keeps his head up for the children in his life, and for this, he deserves some royal Father\\'s Day fanfare.Happy Father\\'s Day, dads!

       " 'Major League Baseball and the Prostate Cancer Foundation teamed up this year to form the Home Run Challenge in honor of Father\\'s Day. Their gift to father\\'s across the country: for each home run hit in 60 selected games between June 6 and today, June 17, raised money for prostate cancer, the second most common cancer for men in the United States.Some fans of this cause made pledges; some posted online tributes to their dads at Dockers San Francisco. For every message submitted, the company donated one dollar. Some messages were even shown in Times Square for all to see.I just checked the status of the Home Run Challenge on this Father\\'s Day morning and found the most updated total of home runs to be 91. Leading the accomplishment are Ken Griffey, Jr., Alex Rodriguez, and Alfonso Soriano. The current Team Home Run leader: the Cincinnati Reds.I\\'m not yet sure how much money was raised. I am sure, though, that one of the best gifts we can give our dads on this special day is a reminder about the importance of prostate cancer screening -- the American Cancer Society recommends doctors offer a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test and digital rectal exam to men over 50 who do not have any major medical problems. This is one gift that requires no shopping, no expense, no pre-planning. Just share the news. Let dad know this screening may just save his life.

       " 'Prescription weight-loss drug Xenical hit drugstore shelves on Friday with a new name -- Alli (pronounced: \"Al-eye\") and with a new non-prescription strength. The newly-named drug is to be more effective with less unpleasureable side effects. Still, there\\'s a problem surrounding this drug, regardless of its name. It\\'s thought to cause colon cancer.The nonprofit group Public Citizen says Alli, made by GlaxoSmithKline, has been shown in mice studies to cause pre-cancerous lesions in the colon. Since there are no long-term studies on humans, this group believes the FDA should not have approved the drug for non-prescription use. It\\'s not clear whether or not the pre-cancerous spots will lead to colon cancer but the mere suggestion that it might is enough, says a Public Citizen spokesperson.\"What we do know is that these lesions occur much more frequently in people who do get colon cancer,\" he said. \"Why do we recommend that everyone get a colonscopy at the age of 50? Because you pick up on these polyps when you do one. And, even though not all of the polyps are pre-cancerous, no (doctor) does a colonscopy without removing every single polyp that is found. And you do this because you know if you don\\'t, it greatly increases the chances of getting cancer.\" The FDA says there is not enough evidence to link Alli and colon cancer -- or breast cancer, another Public Citizen concern.

       " 'In August, it will be one year since I wrote about Lynne, a woman with gallbladder cancer and not a whole lot of information about the disease. There is so little current news on the topic, in fact, that in the archives of all Cancer Blog posts, there is only one about this type of cancer. It\\'s my post about Lynne.Lynne was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer in May 2006 and just a few months later started publishing her blog.\"I was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer, a rare and aggressive form of cancer with a poor prognosis,\" Lynne wrote right away. \"Information was hard to find, and I want to chronicle my experiences, to share what I have learned about this diagnosis and its physical and emotional implications. I also want to explore the spiritual implications of receiving a life threatening diagnosis.\"Ever since she typed her first blog entry, Lynne has been journaling her battle. A recent entry reads:\"Mostly, things bubble along pretty much the same. I have had more pain in the last 10 days or so, but the hospice nurse, Mary, is doing a great job of helping medicate my pain. When I\\'m comfortable and reasonably pain free, I feel better to do other things.\"There is so much more to this brave woman and her story. To learn more about Lynne, click here. To learn more about gallbladder cancer, keep reading.The NumbersIt\\'s estimated that about 9,250 new cases of gallbladder cancer and bile duct cancer (not including bile ducts within the liver) will be diagnosed in 2007 in the United States. About 3,250 people will die of these cancers during the same year. Of all cases, half will be due to gallbladder cancer. But there\\'s good news: the number of deaths from gallbladder cancer has been dropping. Overall, the number of diagnosed cases have dropped by over 50 percent since 1973. Worldwide, this disease is much more common in Asia, Eastern Europe, and South American than it is in the United States.Risk FactorsGender is a risk factor -- women are twice as likely to develop gallbladder cancer than men, and the disease is more common among white women than black women. The risk of developing gallbladder cancer in the United States is highest among Native Americans of New Mexico -- it occurs among this population five times more often than in whites. Age plays a part too. Nearly 75 percent of people with gallbladder cancer are older than 65. Other risk factors include gallbladder polyps, abnormalities in the area connecting the bile and pancreatic ducts, exposure to rubber plants and metal-fabricating industries, salmonella infection, choledochal cysts, gallstones, gallbladder calcium deposits, family history, obesity, and high-carbohydrate, low fiber diets. Most doctors believe chronic inflammation is the major cause of gallbladder cancer. At this time, there is no known method for preventing this disease.SymptomsThe most often reported symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, jaundice, and gallbladder enlargement. Less common are loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal swelling, severe itching, and black tarry stools. It is important to note that these symptoms can also warn of non-cancerous conditions.Detection &amp; DiagnosisGallbladder cancer, detected by methods including history and physical exam, blood tests, ultrasound, CT scan, MRI, angiography and similar tests, laparoscopy, and biopsy, is typically discovered in its most advanced stages, when symptoms start appearing. Only one-fourth of cases are discovered in the early stages. Some gallbladder cases are diagnosed when the gallbladder is removed due to gallstones. Most, however, are diagnosed when a patient seeks medical attention for symptoms.StagingGallbladder cancer is staged using the Roman Numerals 0-IV. The stages break down as follows.Stage 0: Cancer is found only in the lining of the gallbladder and has not spread to lymph nodes, tissues, or organs distant from the gallbladder. Stage IA: The tumor invades the muscle layer yet has not spread to lymph nodes, tissues, or organs.Stage IB: The tumor invades the perimuscular connective tissue yet has not spread to lymph nodes, tissues, or organs.Stage IIA: The tumor invades the serosa layer and/or directly invades the liver and/or one other adjacent organ. It still has not spread to lymph nodes, tissues, or distant organs. Stage IIB: The tumor has spread to local lymph nodes. Stage III: The tumor invades the main blood vessels leading into the liver or several organs outside the liver. It may or may not have spread to lymph nodes.Stage IV: The tumor has spread to tissues or organs distant from the gallbladder. TreatmentThere are two types of surgery for gallbladder cancer. There\\'s potentially curative surgery and palliative surgery. The former may cure the patient of the disease; the latter is performed to relieve pain or prevent complications. Chemotherapy, while ineffective in curing this disease on its own, can be used in conjunction with surgery and radiation.SurvivalOverall, only 15 percent of gallbladder patients survive for five years after diagnosis because most -- nearly 70 percent -- are diagnosed so late. Chances for surviving for five years -- this is just a standard way of discussing prognosis and doesn\\'t predict outcomes for everyone -- are as follows:Stage 0 = 77.5 percentStage I = 48 percentStage II = 27 percentStage III = 9 percentStage IV = 2 percentFor more information on gallbladder cancer, take a peek at these websites:American Cancer SocietyCholangiocarcinoma.orgJohns Hopkins Online Discussion BoardMayoClinic.comNational Cancer InstituteAnd these blogs:Caroline\\'s Cancer DiaryLeafingLife Changing Cancer (this is Lynne\\'s blog) Comments: Ever since she typed her first blog entry, Lynne has been journaling her battle.

       " 'Discussions about cancer often include mention of age. We talk about how old someone is at diagnosis, how old a person is at each year of survival, the age of an individual at the time cancer claims his or her life. Age reveals a lot. It dumps us into statistical categories. Most patients diagnosed with gallbladder cancer, for example, are older than 65. Age sometimes predicts prognosis. Young women diagnosed with breast cancer tend to have more aggressive forms of the disease. This can compromise chances for survival. Age also solicits judgments. \"You are too young,\" some people told me after learning I\\'d been diagnosed with breast cancer.I think about my age all the time. I think about how I was 34 when I found my lump, how I happily arrived at age 35, how I made it to 36, and how today, I am 37. Come November, I will have survived my disease for three years. Three years will remain before I make it out of my 30s and land on 40 -- the age when women should begin receiving regular annual mammograms.I didn\\'t ask for much this year for my birthday. A candle, a bathing suit, dinner out with my husband, and time with family are all I really want -- because the best gift has already arrived. I turned 37. Comments: 1.

       " \"I sometimes complain about the lack of warmth I've encountered from medical professionals throughout my journey with breast cancer. There have been glimpses of compassion. And there are a few who stand out as truly caring and concerned. But there seems to be a general lack of sensitivity. Maybe it's a side effect of the job -- distance -- that I should have been prepared for. But instead I was shocked by how I often felt forgotten, like a number, just one of many in my same boat. And this makes me sad -- for me and for all the others who sail rough waters in search of health. I have waited in lobbies for hours -- four hours one time -- and I've been encouraged to toughen up. I've rarely felt comforted -- except by a few who have hugged me or placed a hand on my shoulder. That's all it takes. A simple gesture or kind word. Words have given me great strength -- and despite my criticism of some of my medical people, the first kind words that came my way were handwritten, on personalized stationery from the surgeon who performed my biopsy and then called me at home with my diagnosis of cancer. He wrote:Just a brief note to let you know that I regret being the messenger of bad news. But I know that you will come through this difficult time healthy and strong. I and my staff wish for you a smooth and speedy recovery. And here are six other sentiments -- from friends and family -- that have helped me survive.You must be so tired from your honorable battle, but I for one am grateful you have the chance to do this battle, rather than the alternative.You've always been a tough cookie and I know you will beat this -- you have to.I hope mostly that you will draw strength from yourself, from that part of you deep down that loves life and knows that every moment spent fighting back is worth it. My impression of you is that (1). You are very witty and (2). You have awesome calf muscles! What can't you overcome with wit and great calves, huh?I think you are gorgeous BALD! When you get to the end of your rope, tie a knot and swing.My own words cannot adequately express what these words have done for me. And what they keep doing for me. They are helping me survive. Comments: 1. I am a 34 month stage 4 lung cancer survivor and ahve been in remission for 26 months. Docs took out the entire right lung; I had mets to center of chest and pericardium (the sack around the heart). My chest was rebuilt with gortex. Had CT and PET scan yesterday and will hear the results in two more days. So,for two more nights, I will not sleep. When will the fear of recurrence ever go away? How do you out there deal with it?\",\n",
       " 'I couldn\\'t help but leave Canyon Ranch a few months back without a fresh take on healthy living. I\\'d spent four days healing myself from the inside out. I\\'d eaten the freshest and most nutritious foods, energized my muscles with twice-daily exercise, and invited therapists to fine-tune my chakras and balance my out-of-whack cancer body. I had my hair cut, my make-up done, my mind cleansed. I was massaged, scrubbed, pedicured, and pampered. I\\'d become relaxed, refreshed, recharged, revitalized. There\\'s no way I could throw all that away.Now back in Florida, I\\'m trying to live like I\\'m at Canyon Ranch\\'s Tucson oasis. I\\'ve changed my diet, committed to exercise, and perhaps most important in the whole scheme of lifestyle change, I\\'m letting go.I\\'ve identified three priorities in my life -- my family, my health, and my sanity. Any extraneous stuff, I\\'m tossing it. Commitments that take me away from my kids: no. Jobs that cause me stress: gone. Responsibilities I don\\'t wish to tackle: I won\\'t. A jam-packed calendar: never again. I tend to go with my gut. If something comes up and I feel a sick little feeling inside, I pass that something right up. I simply let it go.Letting go makes me feel happier, healthier, more in charge of the joy in my life. It\\'s good for my health, good for my soul. It\\'s just plain good. And there\\'s just no way I\\'m letting go of that.Thanks Canyon Ranch for the inspiration. Comments: 1. Important Vitamin and Nutrition FactsNutritional supplements have their greatest benefit by preserving health and preventing future illness. Complete vitamin mineral supplementation is the only effective way to get the full vitamin benefits and ensure that all the essential interactions take place, and this is why a high-quality multi vitamin / mineral supplement is necessary. Your body is a complex machine that requires a ton of minerals and vitamins in order to operate.

       " \"Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell is a cancer survivor. And so she knows the pain and heartbreak associated with the disease. Still, she vetoed a bill that would have allowed people with serious illnesses to use marijuana for medicinal purposes. It's just too problematic and sends mixed messages to children, Rell said in a statement last Tuesday. The decision was a struggle for the Republican Rell, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 and underwent a mastectomy just after taking office. Had she not vetoed the bill, those older than 18 with medical conditions such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, and AIDS would have been permitted to grow and use medical marijuana plants with written permission from a doctor and after registering with the state. Twelve states allow patients to use medical marijuana despite federal laws forbidding it. Connecticut, for now, will not be joininig these states. Comments: 1. The GOV, a cancer survivor must be out of her head to veto the MEDICAL cannabis bill. Tosay it gives children mixed messages is rediculous. IT IS FOR CANCER SUFFERING NOT FOR RECREATIONAL USE....woul dbe say that all muscle relaxers and other PHARMACUETAL mediceins shol dbe outlawed becuase of the same possibilty of mixed messages? The reason is that when a COMPANTY makes a prift on it..its OK in our country..in our government...there are bill under the table payofffs....and donations of political parties...That wouldnthappen with POT, so there is this big DRUG COMPANY LOBBY. I think the GOV shold have died!!!!2. YES THE EVIL REPUBLICAN is responsible for pain and suffering in fellow Americans..REpublicans and hyocritical BORN AGAIN people...are only doing the work for Big Corporatons that donate to their election campaign....Medicine is medicine..POT is not habit forming, addicting, and has rarely any side effects, and will not lead to use of other heavy drugs..ALL LIES&gt;&gt;&gt; The woman should be impeached.3. toni, i hope you get cancer. then you'll get to see how your 'alternatives' really work, not that well. then i hope you have a joint. and see relief. and realize you are in no position to judge the suffering of another or what works for them.4. what is the matter with people? the only message it sends to children is 'no compassion allowed'.it would be barbaric to strap someone to table and perfrom surgery with no anesthesia. is IS barbaric to criminalize something that ameliorates suffering. especially when the alternatives do not work as well and have side effects that make you avoid them5. A smoke filled lungs from whatever the source is just plain wrong and medically harmful. There are plently of alternatives and even THC drugs avaiable such as marinol and soon, Sativex. Most who are pushing these laws are pro drug groups who actually are trying to legalize illicit drugs all over the country. This Governor is a hero to me and the vast majority in the state of CT.6. Ridiculous. The use of ANY drug, prescription or otherwise, can send the wrong message to kids when used irresponsibly. People who legislate the relief of other people's suffering should do some hard time in serious need themselves. Regards,Richard Day Gore7. You don't have to smoke anything.When my mother-in-law was on morphine for breast cancer mets I made a tincture (strong very strong tea) for her and it alleviated her pain without making her high. The morphine had been causing her problems. This is medicine. And for those that cannot see that a plant can be medicine, please look around. Foxglove/digitalis, white willow bark/asperin, dandelion root/potassium sparing diurectic........very sad indeed that this has been taken off the shelf. The opioids cause numerous problems and that is what is usually used for pain.\",\n",
       " \"It's my boys who distract me most from exercise. That's just the way it is. They're kids. They have needs and wishes and demands that keep me busy from sun-up to sun-down. It's hard to find time for fitness. I don't go to a gym. I prefer to use my own treadmill, walk the seven hills in my neighborhood, run outdoors, and conduct my scrunching, pushing, lunging, squatting, and resisting in the privacy of my own home. I don't have a gym membership with free childcare offerings or a list of babysitters who will come to my rescue when I need to huff and puff. I have me, my kids, and the hours in the day, though. And I am trying desperately at fitting fitness in.Today, after enduring what seemed like endless little-boy fighting and tormenting, I determined my guys needed a workout just as much as I did. I threw them in the car. I threw their scooters, a big wheel, and a football in the car too. We drove to a nearby community college track, unloaded ourselves and our gear, and got to work. I ran two miles. And six-year-old Joey and four-year-old Danny scooted, pedaled, walked, ran, climbed a pile of dirt, and threw their football until their faces were splotchy from the heat, their little bodies zapped with fatigue.Our whole fitness feat took no more than one hour and ended as we guzzled water and poured our sweaty selves back into the car. Back home, I felt so much better about my day. And I was better equipped for the fighting that continued as soon as we walked in the door.So here is my thought for the day: Fitness may not perfectly fit into the day. But creatively, it might. Just recently, I proposed to Joey that he train with me for a two-mile fun run in October. He accepted and for several nights, we've been walking and running outside. He told me today he wants to train on the same track we used today.Creativity isn't always easy. And it doesn't always work. Just as Joey might eagerly jump at my exercise invitations, he can just as easily refuse, landing me back at square one. But it's worth a try. It just might work. Like it did for me today.

       " 'Not too many years ago, I got breast cancer. I call it chance, coincidence, fate and on some days, even luck. For today\\'s purposes, I\\'ll call it foreshadowing. I didn\\'t know it then -- way back in 1993 when I did a genogram project in grad school for a counseling class -- but it seems cancer was in my cards. I hinted at the possibility in my research paper and commented on how my family history might put me in the direct line of fire. But my suspicions in no way caused me any worry for the 10 plus years that followed. And still, even after my breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment, I didn\\'t remember I\\'d predicted this might happen to me. Not until I pulled my yellowed, faded assignment from an old box in the garage a few days ago did I realize it\\'s not all that odd that cancer headed right for me.A genogram is a graphic representation of a family tree that displays detailed data on relationships among individuals. It contains names, genders, birth dates, death dates, levels of education, occupations, major life events, and chronic illness. It\\'s not uncommon to find on a genogram patterns of alcoholism, depression, divorce, remarriage, and yes, cancer.In the paper that accompanied my graphical display, I wrote about my paternal grandmother, my paternal grandfather, my paternal great-grandmother, a paternal cousin, and my maternal great-grandmother. They all died of cancer. I noted in one brief sentence the likelihood of this cancer lineage increasing my risk of developing the disease.\"Yep, you should look at the health issues in your family tree,\" my professor wrote on my paper in bright blue ink. \"Scary, but important nonetheless.\"I considered the issues -- for a moment or two -- and then I packed that paper away and completely forgot I\\'d mentioned this frightening family trend. I kind of like that it happened this way. I didn\\'t ever worry about cancer, didn\\'t fear it coming to get me, and never slowed down as I continued on in school, graduated, got married, traveled, worked, and had kids. Waiting for the disease to sneak up on me would have accomplished nothing. Instead, I lived.Cancer eventually snuck up on me. I found it. I fought it. Now it\\'s gone. And here sits my genogram in front of me, written in December 1993, foreshadowing the cancer that invaded my left breast in November 2004. Interesting how life happens, how it unfolds and unravels and then keeps on going. And so in the spirit of life, it\\'s time for me to keep on going. Time to pack that paper back in its box.

Nix the soda. Up the protein. Increase the fiber. Minimize portion sizes. Decrease stress. Rest. Relax. Breath. And exercise -- a lot. I took it all in. I processed it. I stored it in my foggy chemo brain. And I try daily to put my new-found wisdom to work. It\\'s going well -- in part because I have permission to take a break.My Canyon Ranch nutritionist -- the one who taught me how to shop, cook, stock my pantry, and make healthy snacks and treats -- also gave me this happy nugget of news: eat pizza once per week. What? Can that be healthy? Pizza is not the healthiest of food choices. Pizza Hut\\'s personal pan cheese pizza -- you know, the little one containing just four small slices -- has a shocking 620 calories, 26 grams of fat, 69 carbohydrates, and seven grams of sugar. It does have 28 grams of protein. Still, not a very wise choice for those of us wishing to fill our bodies with power foods.How do I know all about the personal pan pizza?

       " 'I received a comment today on my Sunday Seven post about how inspiring sentiments help me survive. The comment was from a women who is surviving lung cancer and she asked a question to all readers really -- when will the fear of recurrence ever go away? How do you out there deal with it? So I replied to her private e-mail address and shared my thoughts about fear and recurrence and how I deal with these issues as a cancer survivor. She replied and wrote, your e-mail was so uplifting. I think I just found you on a really bad day and I am thankful that I did. And so I realized that maybe I should not limit my thoughts to just one person when others are surely in her same boat -- my same boat. So here is what I wrote to this one reader who -- like so many others on my journey -- has helped me by allowing me the chance to help her.Just want to say that I think you are already dealing with the fear-of-recurrence thing because you have been surviving for as long as you have been traveling this bumpy road. So while you survive, you just need to live each day like it\\'s your last and fight for your life at the same time. Someone once told me to think of cancer as a chronic condition -- something we will live with for the rest of your lives. And we just keep treating it, wherever it pops up. And the longer we survive, the more resources there are to help us survive even longer. As for getting through each day, I recommend counseling (I go once per month but at one time I went each week). I also take an anti-depressant (Zoloft) which I do not push on anyone, but for me, it has helped. I went to my oncologist one day and asked him how to live peacefully without worrying constantly that cancer is coming back to haunt me -- he said many cancer patients take anti-depressants to take the edge off so I began the drug and began counseling too. Neither completely take away the fear -- but they help me manage and that\\'s all I can ask for. I also have two little boys who keep me busy and distracted from feeling sorry for myself. And I try to keep busy in other ways too. Helping others with cancer -- or others who just need help -- is healthy too!Helping others with cancer does help me. It reminds me that I am not alone and that others have fears like me and that collectively, we can all survive better if we lean on one another and borrow from one another and inspire one another. Comments: 1. I believe the fear of cancer recurrence is almost as frightening as the cancer itself. I was told that as time goes on, the fear gets less, and it does. However, I never have a day go buy that I think of the cancer the first thing when I awaken and the last thing when I go to sleep. Also, many times during the day. I am a little different in regards to thinking I am a cancer survivor. We all know that a recurrence can happen forever. I don\\'t think the five year mark really means too much other than you have made it that far. I have known women with breast cancer having it recurr after 12 years and one after 20+ years. I am not being pessimistic but I have said that I will never call myself a cancer survivor until I die of something else. Physicians cannot tell us that we are going to be alright, ever. But as I said at the beginning of this remark was that the longer time goes by without a recurrence, the fear subsides a little.2. There must be some truth in \"the longer time goes by without a recurrence, the fear subsides a little.\" Shortly after my wife and I got married and settled into our new house, we called in insurance agents to interview about some life insurance for the both of us. A question was asked, \"Did either of you ever have cancer?\" In all fairness, I never thought my wife was selfish in any way by never bringing it up before. \"It was over twenty years ago, I never thought about it anymore,\" she said. I believed her. The fear did subside in her. She lived her life to the fullest, marrying me and sharing her life, was one of those fullest moments.',\n",

And if this trend holds steady, tobacco will kill 1 billion people by the end of the century -- 10 times the amount of people who died from tobacco in the 20th century. Every one in five cancer deaths results from tobacco use -- worldwide, that's 1.4 million tobacco-related deaths every year. And lung cancer remains the major cancer among the 10.9 million new cases that are diagnosed annually. All this comes from the Cancer Atlas -- updated and released today along with the Tobacco Atlas and published by the American Cancer Society with assistance from the International Union Against Cancer, World Health Organization, and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.While improving nutrition and reducing infection can dramatically reduce cancer rates, reducing tobacco use would have the greatest global affect the number of cancer deaths.

I don't know what action should be taken, I can't imagine a product more people are aware is bad for you.If we're going to spend money on worldwide disease, I'll take something simple that people don't get voluntarily, something like malaria.

I had my initial worries -- about an allergic reaction that I knew caused death within 24 hours for a handful of women and about possible toxicity to the heart -- but after faring well through my first dose and having now successfully completed my one year obligation to the drug, with no allergic reaction or heart damage, I have come to believe the Herceptin might just be the gem of a drug that the media says it is. Yet now I\\'ve read an article that makes me question what I really know about Herceptin -- and the studies that surround it and the statistics that back it and the messages sent out over the lines of mass communication to every day, non-medical people like me.Epidemiologist John Ioannidis believes that most published research findings are false. Latest medical research is wrong about one-third of the time, he says -- or at least that\\'s what the latest research shows. And there are many factors to consider when examining the inaccuracies of research -- like who is sponsoring the study. Typically, researchers are not trying to mislead people. But the sponsor of a study might be. Until recently, few published studies named those who paid for research or whether or not the researcher stood to gain financially. During the past 20 years, money for most clinical studies has not come from the federal government but from pharmaceutical and biotech companies -- and a drug-maker may try several trials until it gets the result it wants. By the time consumers hear about the results, the study may be skewed and flawed and not even applicable to its intended population.Other studies are flawed because they can\\'t get enough subjects for their trials. It took 10 years to get enough women to volunteer for bone marrow transplants to potentially save women with metastatic breast cancer -- and then the trial showed the transplants did not work. Other considerations -- does the study include people of various ages and ethnicities and regions and risk factors -- further complicate the reporting of research to the general public to whom the research may not even apply.There is a whole food chain of confusion, says one doctor of psychiatry, who explains that when research is shared with the general public, there are many unanswered questions -- like what is risk? what is a risk factor? And with cancer treatments, we often hear statements like, \"This drug extended life expectancy for 40 percent of the people.\" But for how long did it extend life? What if it was for just a few weeks? And what if there were huge trade-offs in terms of pain or disruption of healthy living?I have always paid close attention to the facts and figures that apply to my treatments and therapies. I have questioned and analyzed and debated in search of that gut instinct that has guided me well through breast cancer and beyond. Perhaps in the future, though, I will hunt a little more for the buried bits and pieces that might help me make even better decisions about issues that are often so unclear and contradictory. Comments: 1. Bravo! Well written and a lesson to us all. Skepticism is extremely valuable.â\\x80\\x9cMost institutions demand unqualified faith; but the institution of science makes skepticism a virtue.â\\x80? â\\x80\\x94Robert K. MertonI think it would be wise for anyone to read a bit about skepticism before judging the skeptic who responds to a scientific study. I have been called a cynic, but those individuals do not know the difference between cynicism and skepticism. Cynicism requires no distictions to be made begin large and minor problems, reliability and unreliability. It makes blanket statements.Skepticism, on the other hand demands thoughtful inquiry, reflection,what you are proposing.Michael Shermer writes, \"positive skepticism is a way of thinking that leads to deeper understanding, and it is a vital tool in the science kits of practicing scientists.\"<A href=\"http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-09-28.html\" rel=nofollow>http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-09-28.html</A>Thank you for your excellent post.

       " 'I did not know -- until I was sitting in the Cancer Center receiving chemo for breast cancer last year -- that author Barbara Delinsky is a breast cancer survivor.&nbsp; My sister handed me a book off the shelf in this infusion center filled to the brim with cancer patients, all seated neatly in a row on pink leather recliners.&nbsp; I started flipping through the book -- called Uplift: Secrets from the Sisterhood of Breast Cancer Survivors -- when I realized it was written by a best-selling author I had read before.&nbsp; Her novels have caught my attention on several occasions and have been some of the books I have had a hard time putting down.&nbsp; This book was no different.Uplift is a book full of anecdotes and advice and wisdom shared by every-day breast cancer survivors -- and the family, friends, and men in their lives too. Topics include chemo and hair, the workplace, humor, exercise, and religion, among others. And without medical jargon or statistical reports, readers learn from those who have been there -- and want to make the road easier for those who follow.I had to put Uplift back on the shelf once my infusion was complete but days later, I received a package in the mail from a former co-worker and friend.&nbsp; Inside the package was my very own personal Uplift.&nbsp; I have read it and reread it.&nbsp; I have loaned it out and recommended it and quoted from it.&nbsp; It is truly uplifting.&nbsp; Comments: ',\n",
       " 'Mammograms may not be solely for detecting breast cancer anymore -- they may also lead to detection of heart disease. Calcifications may be detected in the arteries of the heart during routine mammograms. Essentially, this indicates hardening of the arteries and can be a sign of heart disease. This is nothing new, really -- doctors have long thought that hardening of breast arteries relate to heart disease. But this relationship had never really been studied -- until recently. Several large studies and many smaller ones have shown a correlation between these vascular calcifications on arteries in the breast because of the similar size to the arteries in the heart. And this correlation revealed itself for one woman -- Bunnie Gleiman -- when she went for her annual mammogram and learned that she had these calcifications on the arteries in her breast. She says her mammogram saved her life -- but not from breast cancer. Now on medications for cholesterol and blood pressure, Bunnie reports that she is happy and healthy. Thanks to her mammogram.

       " \"Lung cancer affects more than 80,000 American women annually. More than 70,000 of these cases are fatal. Thirty thousand more women die from lung cancer than from breast cancer. And lung cancer claims more lives of more women than breast, uterine, and ovarian cancers combined. Yet a new study reveals that American women are uninformed about statistics like these -- and about the threats posed by lung cancer. A 2006 survey of 500 women provides a snapshot of women's attitudes and beliefs about lung cancer -- and the overwhelming conclusion is that there is a widespread lack of awareness about the nation's top cancer killer. And here's the lowdown:   Only 41 percent of women know that lung cancer is the leading cancer   killer in the United States.   Only 8 percent of women know that exposure to radon gas is the second   leading cause of lung cancer -- 60 percent instead believe that second-hand   smoke is the culprit.   Only 36 percent of women know lung cancer kills more women than breast   cancer.   Only 41 percent of women know that one in 17 women will develop lung   cancer sometime in her life.   Only 4 percent of women know that women typically fare better than men   following lung cancer treatment.   And 25 percent of women mistakingly believe that there is a standard   screening test to detect lung cancer in its early stages. Currently, there is   not one. Lung cancer is often believed to be a man's disease. But it is not. It affects tens of thousands of women too. And now I -- as one of the previously uninformed women -- know better. Comments: \",\n",
       " 'Just before my treatment for breast cancer began and during a consultation about what chemotherapy drugs I was about to receive, my oncologist stepped away from my exam room to check on something. When she returned to the room, she told me that she was determining whether or not I qualified for a clinical trial. I had no idea what this meant at the time. All I knew was what she told me -- that my prognosis was too good at that moment to qualify for anything currently under study. I did not fit a profile for anything. I was not a candidate for a clinical trial. I now know that clinical trials are a critical component of research -- they validate a drug\\'s success or weakness and they provide hope for many who may be at the end of their treatment rope and need something new to consider. A clinical trial is a comparison of standard treatments to newer treatments in an effort to discover better methods for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Doctors, scientists, and other health professionals conduct these tests according to strict guidelines set by the Food and Drug Administration -- which establishes mandatory guidelines to ensure the maximum safety of the patient.Clinical trials rely on volunteers -- and sadly, there is a current shortage of patients willing to participate in trials. Experts say that, for the past few decades, just five to 10 percent of all cancer patients in the United States have joined a clinical trial. There is an urgent need -- because the demand for willing, eligible participants far exceeds the supply. Some experts are even recommending that the small pool of candidates that does exist be rationed to only the most important cancer studies -- leaving other studies with no hope for completion. There is no good solution in sight. But the reasons for the shortage are becoming apparent. It\\'s not that patients are unwilling to join. It\\'s that they are unaware, uninformed, not even sure this opportunity is possible -- because doctors are not suggesting trials to their patients. Treatment on a protocol is more demanding for doctors than routine medical care. And it costs doctors to submit to a trial. And trials burden doctors with regulations and paperwork. And some doctors worry about litigation if something experimental goes wrong. So they often don\\'t approach the topic -- and the result is that a wonder drug may sit in a dark freezer because there are not enough people to test it. This potential wonder drug may never show promise, may never save a life, may never see the light of day.So I guess my oncologist was ahead of the game in this matter -- she compared my diagnosis and prognosis with the needs of all available clinical trials and found that there was not match. Had she not done this, I would have never thought to ask about the possibility -- which is exactly what patients should do instead of waiting for a doctor to make the suggestion. Because it may never happen.For more information on clinical trials, please visit the Coalition of Cancer Cooperative Groups. Comments: 1. All the rigorous clinical trials identified are the best treatments for the average patient. But cancer is not an average disease. The tumors of different patients have different responses to chemotherapy. And tumor response (shrinkage) should not be the criteria for approving cancer drugs. A patient responds to therapy when their tumor shrinks, but apparently this has nothing to do with survival. A tumor responds, that is, shrinks a little, then quickly grows and spreads. The cancer comes back with a vengeance and the cancer patient is given a death sentence.The FDA is signaling that it\\'s open to developing better approaches to the design of clinical trials, approaches that can shift midcourse. It is something called \"adaptive trials\" that allow them to route larger groups of patients to more promising treatments in the middle of trials, and drop treatments that seem ineffective in early testing. The FDA has begun to show some openness to accepting these new types of trials in its assessment and approval process.Dr. Scott Gottlieb, Deputy Commissioner for Medical and Scientific Affairs, spoke about this at a recent speech before the Conference on Adaptive Trial Design. He said \"clinical trials are highly empirical, testing drugs on general populations and then look for clinical response and a treatment effect that is not likely to be a chance result.\" He added, \"new scientific tools and approaches could help to learn more about the safety and efficacy of new medicines perhaps more quickly and earlier in the development process.\"Getting better drug development tools from advances in proteomics, genomics, and cellular profiling, holds the key to solving some of the problems confronting a healthcare system that is seeking ways to best allocate available resources while accomplishing the critical task of matching individual patients with the treatments most likely to benefit them.Genomic testing with cell culture analysis is a good way to start in developing a program to discover gene expression microarrays, which predict for responsiveness to drug therapy. The way to identify informative gene expression patterns is to have a gold standard and cell culture assays are by far the most powerful, efficient, useful gold standard to have.The assay is the only assay that involves direct visualization of the cancer cells at endpoint. This allows for accurate assessment of drug activity, discriminates tumor from non-tumor cells, and provides a permanent archival record, which improves quality, serves as control, and assesses dose response in vitro, and includes newly-emergent drug combinations.',\n",
       " \"For the almost two years I have been receiving treatment for breast cancer, I have traveled the same path -- over and over and over again -- from my house to the hospital and back again. And while I have seen different doctors and received different treatments and visited various departments and locations for all sorts of surgeries and tests and scans and X-rays, the path has remained the same. And after all the time that has passed, the power of the path has never diminished -- despite how familiar it has become. Today I drove from my house to the hospital for a counseling appointment. I drove the same stretch of highway for a few miles, got off on my usual exit, drove for a few more miles past all the typical shopping centers and restaurants, and came to the light where I always turn left into the Cancer Center. I drove into the parking lot, found a parking space -- thankfully -- and displayed my yellow patient parking permit that allows to park without fear of a $20 ticket. I got out of my car and began my walk to the main hospital where the psychology clinic is located. I passed -- as usual -- the startling crowds of people smoking outside the Cancer Center, the groups of medical students who gather outside the medical facilities, the masses of people in white coats racing around and checking beepers and talking on cell phones. I entered the hospital, traveled to the ground floor, and turned a few corners until I reached my clinic. I checked in, paid my $25 co-pay, and waited for a just a few minutes until I was greeted by my counselor. We walked to a private room, talked for an hour, and then I followed my path in reverse. The path is always the same. It is routine and predictable and rarely varies. But it has never become dull and I have never become numb to it -- because the power that is wrapped up in my drive and my subsequent steps that take me to and from my destinations still has a tight hold on me. I can travel the same path for other purposes -- to shop or have dinner -- and the power is lost. But when I travel for reasons all about cancer, the power overwhelms me. It happened today -- as I drove listening to the same CD I always play on these missions, as tears filled my eyes. I was not sad -- just overflowing with emotion. Emotion about all that I've encountered -- the encounters with fear and dread and total repulsion and the encounters with hope and joy and pure contentment. Today I felt powerful. Simply powerful. Because I have overcome what has faced me so far and because I am still traveling the same road, the same path to ensure my future health and well-being -- which is something I hope to become all too familiar with.

       " \"When I first started going to counseling, I was told I would need eight to 10 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy to help me deal with my anxiety, my panic, my fear of breast cancer recurrence. My first session was in May 2005 -- and I am still going. Those initial sessions are possibly all I really needed -- and perhaps I could have stopped the therapy long ago. But stopping never came up and no one told me I had to call it quits so I kept on marching into territory I had never before traveled. I have a degree in counseling -- but I'd never been counseled. I know how to listen to others and share empathy and ask open-ended questions -- but I'd never been the one talking and sharing and venting and crying and answering questions. Until last May -- when I discovered the appeal and the comfort of the counseling chair.I marched into one of my sessions yesterday and plopped into a brown faux leather recliner. I talked about my recent graduation from Herceptin therapy and about how I might manage in life now that treatment is over. I talked about my jobs -- as a writer and a preschool teacher -- and how they fit into my world. I talked about the level of stress in my days and about how my once constant fear that cancer was trailing me has largely diminished. I talked about how breast cancer is no longer my constant companion -- about how it is now just an acquaintance. And I talked about how counseling was once so necessary and about how it is now just a luxury that helps me maintain peace as I live forward.I am not sure when I will stop going to counseling. But I'm not completely sure of much anymore. And I've learned from counseling to not really question the future -- to just live in the moment and to give thought primarily to the here and now. And right here, right now, I'm sticking with my sessions, my one hour every month, my comforting counseling chair. Comments: 1. Don't know much about cancer counseling, mainly because there was no such thing at our so-called regional cancer center. Don't know much about the team approach to cancer care either, mainly because there was no such team at our so-called regional cancer center.In fact, during the eight years my wife was being seen by the oncologists, I often wondered what were they doing? One thing noticed was she saw a different oncologist on each visit to the office (much like musical chairs). I never understood why? Who was in charge?One of the wisest decisions we made when the first recurrence happened (after twenty-four years), was to go to a NCI-designated cancer center for treatment. However, after surgery, we went to our local community hospital. There was a shift, some twenty years ago, from the institution-based, inpatient setting to community-based, ambulatory sites for treating the majority (over 83%) of the nation's cancer patients.It's so good to hear that some cancer centers are doing this counseling that Jacki so eloquently relates to. And coming from a counselor herself. I'm sure it would have helped my wife and me. I'm sure when Jacki looks back from the future, she'll know that it was comforting. \",\n",

       " \"As if the horrors of breast cancer are not enough -- surgery and recovery, chemotherapy and recovery, radiation and recovery, additional treatments and recovery -- weight gain often comes along and rounds out the full breast cancer package. It is most common for women who have chemotherapy -- the curse is not often seen for women who have surgery alone or surgery followed by radiation -- and while it may seem the lesser of all evils for some women, others may be plagued by an additional battle with weight. In addition to the self esteem blow that breast cancer delivers -- complete with scars and removal of breasts and reconstruction and hair loss -- weight gain in this body-image obsessed era can take its toll. There are also health concerns related to weight gain -- and an excess of weight is reported to sometimes influence a return of breast cancer and can be a risk factor for other cancers too.The American Cancer Society reports that the average weight gain is five to eight pounds over a year's time -- but that gaining 25 pounds is not uncommon either. This phenomenon is somewhat of a mystery, although there are some theories about why women are at risk for this not-so-pleasant side effect of breast cancer. Some women get nauseated during chemotherapy and don't eat much -- but others have intense food cravings and tend to eat more. Body composition may also change and research shows that chemotherapy possibly diminishes lean body mass and increases fatty tissue. Menopause may also be to blame -- natural and chemically-induced menopause operate the same and both slow metabolism. So it takes more physical activity to burn what less activity accomplished prior to chemotherapy. Women experiencing treatment also tend to exercise less which can contribute to weight gain. And some women fault the Tamoxifen they take following chemotherapy -- although research does not support a strong link between the two. There are many possibilities. Yet none of them are definite. There is one definite, though -- a healthy menu, a healthy exercise routine, and a healthy support team can help women ward off this unfair consequence of an unfair disease. Comments: 1.

       " 'There is no doubt that the new cervical cancer vaccine -- Gardasil -- is revolutionary. But writer Peter Sprigg, vice president for policy at the Family Research Council, shared yesterday on the washingtonpost.com that the public should consider two cautions when digesting the news of this breakthrough medical advance. He urges us, first, to understand that the vaccine is not 100 percent effective. It is 100 percent effective for the strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) it targets -- but it leaves 30 percent of HPV strains that cause cervical cancer untouched. And it does not prevent all cases of genital warts either. So it is largely effective. But it does not completely eradicate the disease. Sprigg also believes that parents should determine whether or not their young girls get the vaccine -- that it should not be mandatory. Mandating the vaccine might be in order if HPV was spread through blood or casual contact. But it is not -- it is spread by sexual contact. And families of young girls might best address this issue through education on behavioral issues alone, without interference from the government.The wonder of the cervical cancer vaccine is not in question by this writer and the council he represents. But there is often a full picture that lingers behind good news and sensational headlines. And Peter Sprigg offers his take on what he believes lingers behind. Comments: 1. Abstinence programs don\\'t work <A href=\"http://www.alternet.org/story/37956/\" rel=nofollow>http://www.alternet.org/story/37956/</A>and they are a colossal waste of money. The gentleman from the FRC won\\'t tell you that.Sprigg believes it is purely up to the parents, yet do they follow their teens around and monitor them all day to make sure they won\\'t get the STD?\"...without interference from the govenment.\" That\\'s another conservative hot button, but then they want the government to decide choices about birth, marriage, and death.\"But there is often a full picture that lingers behind good news and sensational headlines.\"The full picture is that this IS a sensational scientific development. This is a incredible and rare opportunity to crush the 10,000 new cases of cervical cancer that occur each year resulting in approximately 4,000 deaths. Worldwide, where screening programs have not been as available as in the U.S., the toll is much higher, with approximately 500,000 cases diagnosed each year.About two-thirds of all sexually active people can expect to become infected with HPV at some point in their lives, making it the most common STD in this country. The HPV vaccines that have been developed are very effective at decreasing the number of high-risk HPV infections (91 percent effective). And, most importantly, they\\'re effective at decreasing the number of persistent infections - the ones tha lead to cervical cancers. (100 percent).The 70% coverage is correct, however we do not do yet know whether the vaccine will offer cross-immunity to the other high-risk types, a possibility.Women who have been vaccinated will still need to have cervical cancer screening with Pap smears. It\\'s also important for all sexually active, vaccinated women to continue to use condoms--again because the vaccine does not protect against all HPV types, and it offers no protection at all against other sexually transmitted diseases. In recent years, religious conservatives have become increasingly reliant on HPV as a tool to attack condoms. They have denigrated condom use as â\\x80\\x9cRussian roulette,â\\x80? relying on false claims that condoms fail to provide any protection for HPV. They would actually have us believe that condoms increase HPV incidence. Although condoms may not eliminate the risk of transmitting HPV, the CDC recommends them for risk reduction (CDC, 2001). Since HPV may shed beyond the covered area, however, condoms do not provide as complete protection as they do for some other pathogens, such as HIV and gonorrhea. The claims of condom-use opponents who suggest that condom use leads to increased numbers of HPV infections are false and alarmist. Condom use cannot be blamed for the high prevalence of HPV infection or the incidence of cervical cancer among women in the U.S. The young age group for administration of the vaccine was chosen because it\\'s important to give the vaccine before HPV infection has occurred through sexual contact. The vaccine has not been found to be an effective treatment for already existing HPV infection.There are few cancers that are understood to the degree cervical cancer is, and even fewer for which a comparably effective prevention has been discovered. Widespread adoption of this vaccine should mean that future generations of women will be able to avoid cancer.Teach your teen about the vaccine AND spend some time talking to her about Mr. Spriggs\\' agenda. Keep her fully informed. ',\n",
       " 'If I could go back in time, I would not repeat my journey with breast cancer. I would choose a different path -- one free of disease and treatment and the fear that comes with it all. I would choose the route where my children would never hear me say, \"mommy has cancer.\" The route where there would be less worry about dying, less worry about how my kids would do without me, less worry about how all my loose ends would be tied up without me here to tie them. I would choose another direction in a heartbeat. But there are some things I do treasure about my trip down breast cancer lane -- some things I do not wish to give back, even if given the chance to choose a different path. They are the hidden treasures I discovered along the way, in the midst of a harrowing, sometimes horrendous battle. There are many treasures that have come my way -- and I\\'m sure there are more to come. Here are seven of my valuable finds.Hair. My greatest cancer fear -- losing my hair -- was realized when chemotherapy took my long, blond, straight hair and left me with a bald head and some light fuzz scattered here and there. My hair came back -- but I now have dark, curly hair. I always wished for curls and spent many years and lots of money on perms to temporarily curl my locks. So now my wish has come true and although it\\'s still quite shocking to look at myself in the mirror, I really do like my hair. Counseling. I have uncovered the healing value of counseling -- and the comfort and peace that comes from talking with someone who knows me only because of my cancer. My once-weekly and now-monthly mental health visits keep me on track as I move forward as a breast cancer survivor. And counseling helps me in other areas of my life too. I have talked about parenting and family issues and have gathered some priceless tools for making decisions, balancing priorities, and managing my world.Fitness. I am in better shape now than I have ever been -- because cancer made me feel weak and tired and I was not content allowing this to linger. I have always walked for exercise, have never been an overeater, and always thought I was doing the best I could do. Until I found a fitness trainer and starting lifting weights and challenging myself physically. Now I can actually see definition in my arms and legs, I feel stronger and tighter, and I know my workouts contribute to better overall health. Writing. Cancer has led me back to my love for writing. I began my college career more than 15 years ago as a journalism major. But the tides changed and I coasted toward other interests and I ultimately pursued a graduate degree in counselor education. When cancer struck, I began a blog that became my mode of communication for family and friends and later my therapeutic release. Blogging turned into offers to write for pay -- like I am doing now -- and I find that this is really what I want to be doing long-term.Giving. Receiving support and help and motivation and wisdom and financial assistance and gifts has made me want to share all this in return. So I give to charities when I once would refuse any involvement. I raise money for events that benefit cancer research. I help others who follow in my path and offer whatever wisdom I think might soothe their souls. The least I can do is spread the same hope that was shared with me. Moments. Cancer has given me the ability to cherish my moments -- the moments with little boys who dance around the living room without a care in the world and swim in the neighborhood pool, proud of their every jump and plunge and twist and turn in the water. These are the moments I don\\'t want to lose. And realizing I could lose them makes me treasure them even more.Contentment. I was born a perfectionist, a Type A personality. My mom remembers my cries about crooked pony-tails and my refusal to go to school until my hair was just perfect. My house has always been clean and neat, my drawers and cabinets organized, my chores and tasks outlined in writing every day. And I still have these tendencies -- but I don\\'t fret about them so much and I am able to let go more. I am content to leave the house with toys scattered all over the floor and dishes in the sink and laundry wrinkling in the dryer. I might not prefer this arrangement at first but I forget about it, don\\'t stress about it, and find that contentment does not come from how well my stuff is ordered. It comes from the precious moments that I might miss if I was instead tending to the details that in the whole scheme of things, don\\'t really matter.Cancer doesn\\'t necessarily make me happy. It makes me sad and worried and scared and overwhelmed. But it has done some good too. And I am thankful for that. Comments: ',\n",
       " 'The tunnel was long. And dark. And winding. And foggy. And ominous. It seemed to last forever -- at the time -- and at moments, time seemed to stand still. I was not sure if I\\'d ever pass through it and be okay -- if I\\'d ever see the light at the end. But I did. I tunneled through it all -- somehow -- and I came out feeling more alive than ever before. Now, some time after my escape from the fog, I am already taking for granted the fact that I am breathing, that I am healthy, that I am living. And when my fitness trainer noticed yesterday that I do not get dizzy and lightheaded anymore during my workouts -- when I once had to sit down, breathe, collect my whereabouts -- I realized that some of my progress since exiting my breast cancer tunnel is already lost on me. And I don\\'t want to lose sight of where I was and how far I\\'ve come. I want to remember it and measure it and never forget how alive I am at this very moment. So I have started to really think about how things have changed since I felt stuck in time, in a dark place. I am thinking about my times in a hospital bed when I was barely able to stand up, barely able to walk a few steps without feeling like I would collapse. Now I can hop out of bed at a moment\\'s notice, half asleep in response to a demanding child screaming from his bed. I am thinking about my once challenging pre-cancer exercise routine and how a time came when my legs felt so heavy I could not even contemplate walking down my street. Yesterday, I completed an hour of weight training. Today I ran for 20 minutes. Tomorrow, I go back for more weight training. And I remember feeling incoherent, unable to conjure of meaningful thoughts or sentences. And now, despite some potential chemo brain forgetfulness, I am back on track.I have only just touched the surface. There is so much more to reflect on. So I plan to think more about my travels so I can better appreciate how I arrived at the exact place where I am right now -- where it\\'s light and clear, where time passes at normal speed, where I feel lucky to be alive.

       " 'Medulloblastoma is a brain tumor that usually occurs in children between the ages of three and eight. It accounts for 20 percent of all brain tumors in children. Treatment for medulloblastoma can involve surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.In a study published in the Lancet Oncology, the treatment of risk-adapted radiation and a shortened course of high-dose chemotherapy may improve outcomes in children with high-risk tumors. Risk-adapted radiation means that the dose of the radiation was adapted to the risk status of the child. Children with a high risk medulloblastoma received a higher dose of radiation where children with an average risk medulloblastoma received a lower dose. Children with high risk medulloblastoma are defined as cancer that has spread within the brain or spinal cord.The study included 134 children between the ages of three and twenty one. After five years the overall survival was 85 percent in children with average risk disease and 70 percent in children with high risk disease.The researchers concluded from this study that risk-adapted radiation therapy and a shortened course of high-dose chemotherapy may improve outcomes in children with high risk medulloblastoma.

Drugs like casodex and similar have value but also have some side effects that are nasty a bit. Seldom mentioned is the cancer fighting drug for prostate cancer namely DES (man made estrogen) drug. It is very cheap in price, does cause direct apoptosis of PCa cells and actually retains or builds bone density (while other drugs rob it from you and thin your bones). Cost is almost free too. Compare DES 1-mg (100) count at $25 to Casodex 50 mg of 100 for probably $1000 retail (insurance will pay). Might I add that I have used both the mainstream drugs of Lupron-Zoladex-Casodex-Proscar and DES outperformed them all with test results too, and little or no side effects. Countrary to some discussion 1-mg of DES or even using 1/2 mg. is still effective and does not cause blood clots, used with 81 mg aspirin (1-tablet normal size). I had great results with this and no problems. Lupron billings was around $8400 per year, Zoladex was less some. DES per year was $100, cheaper than vitamins too. Truth shall set you free.2. Robert, thanks for recounting your experience with DES. I\\'m wondering if you were lucky using the aspirin to prevent clots or are on to something. In \"A Primer on Prostate Cancer -- The Empowered Patient\\'s Guide,\" pp. 154-155, it says: \"Although many physicians are using aspirin in place of Coumadin [\"to prevent thrombotic events associated with antithrombin-III deficiency\"], aspirin has no effect against antithrombin-III deficiency. Therefore, aspirin will not abolish the abnormal coagulation findings in patients treate wih PC SPES and other oral estrogenic compunds including DES and Emcyt.\" I\\'ve taken that at face value and not checked it at PubMed. Have you looked into this issue?I have a rooting interest as DES or some other estrogenic approach could be a fallback for me if intermittent triple androgen deprivation fails. So far, I\\'m doing very well with a PSA of 0.02 and falling on my second round of triple blockade in my seventh year of diagnosis with a very challenging case.Jim (website: <A href=\"http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147\" rel=nofollow>http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147</A>)3. Thank you Kristina for calling our attention to this hot-off-the-press news!I just checked for the study in PubMed after reading the linked article. I found it, as well as interesting related articles.Basically, the solidifying conclusion based on large trials is that bicalutamide (Casodex) at 150 mg helps delay or prevent progression in a very significant way for men who have had radiation for locally advanced cancer, but does not help those who have had radiation but do not have locally advanced cancer (those whose cancer is confined to the prostate), and it may even do slight harm. This is extremely useful information in tailoring therapy to the patient.Robert alluded to side effects of bicalutamide (and other anti-androgen drugs like flutamide). The set of studies indicates clearly that many patients experience breast issues such as enlargement, tenderness and pain, though generally not to a great degree. There are known ways of dealing with those side effects, but they need to be considered. An earlier report about the same series (Tyrrell CG, Payne H, See WA and others 2005) stated: \"The most common adverse events were breast pain (74.8%) and gynecomastia [breast enlargement] (66.6%), which were mild to moderate in &gt;90% of cases.\"My impression is that intermittent triple blockade does a better job of reducing cancer impact, but it is expensive, as Robert noted, and it has a different set of side effects. Also, it is not at all as well documented, with no randomized, double-blind placebo controlled clinical trials. (That said, I\\'m a firm believer that it will prove highly effective when trials finally are run.) I\\'ve read that intermittent triple blockade has a much better profile of breast side effects than blockade with just anti-androgens alone.Jim (web site: <A href=\"http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147\" rel=nofollow>http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147</A>)',\n",
       " 'One of the most difficult things about receiving the gold standard of chemotherapy for your specific cancer is the fact that the cancer cells are not being tested to actually see if that chemotherapy will work for you.

In one study of lung cancer treatment:\"Overall time to progression was 5.33 months (95% CI 4.2â\\x80\\x935.6). Time to progression according to ERCC1 SNP genotype was 4.1 months (95% CI 1.2â\\x80\\x936.9) for 34 patients heterozygous for C/T and 5.8 months (95% CI 3.8â\\x80\\x937.8) for 17 patients homozygous for the rare alleles T/T, while it was 8.4 months (95% CI 3.2â\\x80\\x9313.6) for 11 patients homozygous for the wild-type C/C (P=0.03). Time to progression was 5.3 months (95% CI 4â\\x80\\x936.6) for all 51 patients with non-wild-type genotypes considered as one group (P=0.02). No other significant differences in time to progression were observed according to SNP genotype.\" There was a difference but it wasn\\'t great. As far as testing different chemotherapy regimens? Well, we have little evidence of that at all despite what one may hear from bloggers and a few scientists. Luckily, those prospective studies are now beginning.<A href=\"http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/15/8/1194#F1\" rel=nofollow>http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/15/8/1194#F1</A>2. Improving cancer patient diagnosis and treatment through a combination of cellular and gene-based testing will offer predictive insight into the nature of an individual\\'s particular cancer and enable oncologists to prescribe treatment more in keeping with the heterogeneity of the disease. The biologies are very different and the response to given drugs is very different.Over the past few years, gene expression profiling has been suggested as the best or only way of determining ex vivo drug sensitivity. However, the clinical application of these DNA content assays have been shown to correlate only with response and not survival. And due to almost all patients being treated with combination chemotherapy, this methodology cannot even be calibrated without the use of whole cell profiling. Cell function analysis with whole cell profiling can actually integrate all the gene expression into one convenient test result.In obtaining information from gene mutations (DNA content assays) and/or gene expression (RNA content) it must be realized that DNA structure is only important insofar as it predicts for RNA content, which is only important insofar as it predicts for protein content, which is only important insofar as it predicts for protein function, which is only important insofar as it predicts for cell response, which is only important insofar as it predicts for tumor response and function. In other words, it correlates only with response and not survival, in entirely retrospective (not prospective) studies.There is whole cellular profiling (Cell Function Analysis) that shows data indicating a near doubling in the survival of patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer, striking correlations between platinum activity and patient survival in previously-untreated ovarian cancer, and a comprehensive meta-analysis of scores of studies reporting response and survival correlations in thousands of patients.Plus a recent study using angiogenesis assay describing correlations between cell culture assay results in response to Iressa, and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. These correlations were based on the actual assay results which had been reported, in real time, prospectively to the doctors who had ordered the assay laboratory tests. There were striking correlations between test results and patient survival, not just response.Not only is whole cellular profiling a very important predictive test, but it is a unique tool for identifying newer, better drugs, testing drug combinations, and serving as a \"gold standard\" to develop new DNA, RNA, and protein-based tests of drug activity.

AACR\\'s prevention meeting from last year would probably also list some studies. AACR researchers spend more time on basic type research than clinical research, so you will see more of that. There might be studies on green tea at www.asco.org, the site of the American Society for Clinical Oncology.It\\'s obvious that green tea is getting a lot of attention.I still drink a lot, 4 to 10 bags worth per day, to try to improve my chances with prostate cancer.

For example, without a little acid in the cup, the polyphenols lose much of their strength as they oxidize. You can see the change in color. Just a few drops of lemon juice takes care of that problem. Since I drink a lot of green tea, most is decaffeinated, and a decaf process that is not natural apparently cuts the strength of the polyphenols. Brewing the tea longer increases strength, as does dunking or stirring the tea bags. On the other hand, one study indicated that consuming milk or even soy milk near the time the tea was consumed would cut the strength of the polyphenols substantially.As you say, at least we are getting some other benefits from it even if it turns out that it does not help fight cancer. In my mind, that issue is not yet decided.Jim (web site: <A href=\"http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147\" rel=nofollow>http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147</A>)',\n",

The tumor had started to grown out of my rectum. The pain was so fierce I wanted to drive my car off the freeway. When I went to meet the radiolist he said to me,that I was wasting my time by doing the chemo/radiation prior to my surgery. That no amount of radiation would shrink a tumor of that size. I could hardly have a bowel movement. But my oncologist said she wanted to try to save some of my rectum. So I did 5 weeks of chem/radiation. The tumor shrunk really fast. So fast I thought it was a sign not to have the surgery. Which would be a permanted removal of the rectum. I went to many doctors for a second opion about the surgery. All of them said have the surgery. Better to be safe than sorry. I was only 42. The though of wearing the bag for the rest of my life didn\\'t appeal to me. Nor did dieing of cancer. But I felt that the cancer was gone. So I passed on the surgery. I go to the doctors every 3 months for a check up so far so good. I was kicked into earlie menopause. I end up gaining 50lbs . No trying to lose the weight. I would reccomend the the chemo/radi as treatment. Even though the radiation weakens your bowels. Mine havn\\'t return to normal yet. 2. Surgery is generally used if it can cure the cancer. It is most useful in cancers that have not spread. Even if the cancer has spread to only one area or is small, then it may be possible to remove it completely with surgery. It is likely that surgical skill is a more important determinant of prognosis than the aggressive nature of the cancer or its stage at diagnosis.Some surgeons view chemotherapy as a remedy for \"bad\" surgery. Chemotherapy just isn\\'t good enough to make up for surgical mistakes (e.g. failure to get good margins, tumor spills during surgery, etc.). The most important prognostic factor is the surgeon!Most good surgeons would explain that the reason for better survival for patients who could undergo complete resection without any tumor left behind is that these tumors are biologically less aggressive and would do better regardless of the type of treatment they receive, and that the removal of lymph nodes at the time of surgery may additionally contribute to a better outcome.Surgery is an integral part of the multimodality treatment of many cancers. The line of reasoning frequently used to explain the value of surgery includes five points:1. Surgery is thought to remove resistant clones of tumor cells and thus decrease the likelihood of the early onset of drug resistance (if one was going to have chemo).2. The removal of large masses likely to be associated with poorly vascularized areas of tumor improves the probability of delivering adequate drug doses to the remaining cancer cells (if there are any).3. The higher growth fraction in better vascularized small masses enhanced the effect of chemotherapy.4. Smaller masses require fewer cycles of chemotherapy and thus decreased the likelihood of drug resistance.5. Removal of bulky disease enhances the immune system.',\n",

Researchers from Turkey had confirmed that a regimen of Carboplatin and Gemzar was effective for the treatment of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. Participants in the study included women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer whose disease had recurred more than six months after discontinuing first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. It was concluded that the combination of Gemzar and Carboplatin is a feasible treatment option for patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. The details of this phase II study were reported in the February 2005 issue of Gynecologic Oncology.The superiority of the addition of Gemzar to Carboplatin (14% vs 6%) for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer that has recurred in the clinical trial stated in this post, seems to merit widespread use. Gemzar and Platinum (whether Cisplatin, Carboplatin or Oxyplatin) has been a \"powerful\" drug combination found effective against a range of cancers, discovered through drug sensitivity tests reported at the 34th annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Los Angeles, CA.However, giving this combination to everyone would not be that helpful, because the organ toxicity, immunosuppression, and mutagenicity of the combination cancels out in many patients, the gains in a few, fortunate patients. More emphasis should be put on matching treatment to the patient and having more respect for minimal partial response or stable disease.What you may want to do is to reserve the aggressive therapy for those patients who will derive more benefit than harm, while identifying the most promising treatment regimens for everyone. In patients with tumors very resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy in general, the most promising treatments may include angiogenesis inhibitors, growth factor inhibitors, or more integrative medicine approaches.It could be that a better approach for treating recurrent cancer is not to give more aggressive and toxic and mutagenic and immunosuppressive combinations, but to give targeted single agents, or to give the least toxic and mutagenic active combinations. Higher response rates don\\'t necessarily lead to improved clinical outcomes.2. \"discovered through drug sensitivity tests reported at the 34th annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Los Angeles, CA.\"The approval of the combination is not based on drug sensitivity tests of a decade ago, but a recently completed, evidence-based, study:<A href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=16966687&amp;query_hl=5&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum\" rel=nofollow>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=16966687&amp;query_hl=5&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum</A>For now, \"the Gynecological Oncology Group has approved the concept of performing a trial to assess assay directed therapy for patients with platinum resistant epithelial ovarian carcinoma.

If I\\'m correct and they have not changed the design, GOG intends to treat patients and only then use the assay to select therapy. A prior paper already established that the assay can identify a small percentage of patients who will not respond (i.e. EDR), but then when the results were used to select an non-EDR alternative, it did not provide responses. Thus, using non-EDR drugs will not improve outcomes. In this light, the EDR assay has the advantage of telling you who will not respond but cannot in any way change the death sentence by selecting an active alternative. Perhaps the EDR can give more time to select a mortuary. The best trial is a first-line study, no prior therapy, assay versus a control.However, greed and certitude in the power of the dollar have once again clouded judgement. Not everyone is willing to sell his principles so cheaply. The persons making these decisions are not friends of cell culture assays, but they are smart and cynical enough to accept baksheesh from the very persons whose technology they are bent upon discrediting. It\\'s death by clinical trial, the academician\\'s weapon of choice, which they wield expertly. These guys know very well what they are doing. In essence, it\\'s \"Thanks but we\\'ve heard these arguments before - no need trouble yourself by repeating them.\" Good grief, they aren\\'t even trying to make it appear as though they are doing the right thing.Different methods of assay endpoint results should be applied in choosing a particular drug regimen to be used in treating an individual patient\\'s cancer. Different methods of assay endpoints will sort the different reasonable treatment regimens into the different groups (above-average, average, below-average and very below-average), which would direct attention away from regimens \"less\" likely to provide benefit and toward regimens which are \"more\" likely to provide benefit.In the meantime, over the last 15 years, there is the gyn-onc who doesn\\'t get paid for 40% of all the care he provides. He\\'ll take a patient who is medically indigent after using up all of her insurance and, knowing he won\\'t make a penny, will start operating at 9 AM and will proceed to spend the next twelve hours removing every last vestige of tumor. And then spend many hours over the next week providing post-op care. And then gives assay directed therapy with drugs which would make him no money, even if the patient did have insurance. All in the science of saving lives.I believe the best one in the series of JCO \"Correspondence\" letters is the one from Dr. Michael Castro.

Resistance to change may be active, covert, or organized from vested interests. It is unrealistic to expect independent change to tackle vested interest resistance, but change can signal to those interests, such interventions may be few but telling. Aside from everything we understand about ignorance, misunderstanding, personal and institutional agendas, and profit motive, is the fact that a decade-long campaign of side-door avenues and access-buying was done in the best political tradition.These vested interests had been agnostic on the use of assays, but supposidly appointed a panel to study them. In the meantime, they want to make certain that they\\'ll still get paid if they choose to use drugs which perform poorly in the assays. However, patients should receive what is best for them and not what is best for their oncologists. Here and there around the world, there are decisions still being made by oncologists who aren\\'t in the pockets of American Big Business. They espouse individual intelligence, integrity and curiosity.Pithy eloquence from Dr. Castro\\'s correspondence: \"should it (assays) be denied to patients, including those who walk in the door asking for it? Such an extreme proscription against (assay) testing outside a clinical trial makes it sound as if the existing data on the subject are largely negative. Yet, the review (of assays) hardly establishes such grounds for a summary admonition. Thus, we should reject their extreme proscription.\"Maybe there is a glimmer of hope? A tribute to my dearly beloved spouse and a hundred thousand other ovarian cancer patients.8. \"Resistance to change may be active, covert, or organized from vested interests.\"Luckily, there are those in the assay community who are beginning to perform testing to see if there is any legitimate benefit. Of course, THEY have a vested interest and there are good scientists at these biotechs. They know the importance of good research BEFORE espousing unproven benefit and declaring to cancer patients that they are doomed if they don\\'t get one. (Almost sounds like a guy I know who tells me my family is doomed as terror will overtake us if I don\\'t vote for members of his party.)So they\\'ve begun studies.\"they want to make certain that they\\'ll still get paid if they choose to use drugs which perform poorly in the assays.\"No evidence of this cynicism which can\\'t help but create fear in a cancer patient.\"Such an extreme proscription against (assay) testing outside a clinical trial makes it sound as if the existing data on the subject are largely negative.\"There is no data. Finally, real clinical benefit is being studied. But, it\\'s just the beginning. No benefit can be claimed. The inference from accuracy to claim of benefit only exists in the minds of the purveyors of imaginary information at this time. I hope it does benefit, but I will not create fear in patients, indicating to them that they have been \"given a death sentence\" as an incredible small minority (count them on one hand, maybe one finger) would have you believe.\"extreme proscription?\" Ugh. Again.A tribute?9. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center is taking a new look at how to evaluate new medicines and treatments for cancer. They are rethinking how they design and conduct clinical trials in the United States. Dr. Donald Berry, one of its scientists, feels that they should turn the \\'statistical method\\' used to evaluate new drugs on its head because it limits innovation and learning.They adopted the Bayesian method of science (with its algorithms) because it is more in line with how science works. They put this approach to the test with more than 100 cancer-related phase I and II clinical trials being planned or carried out using the Bayesian approach. Of course, the Bayesian method is no stranger to the technology of Cell Culture Assay Testing. In fact, it is what gives credit to the accuracy of assay testing.Clinical trials test the efficacy (not the accuracy) of a drug. The efficacy of a drug is to produce a desired effect, which is tumor response (shrinkage). Single arm clinical trials provide the tumor response evidence that is the basis for approving new cancer drugs. The Bayesian methodology can bring some much-needed accuracy to the forefront of clinical trials.Clearly, more effective cancer therapies are desperately needed, and after 30 years of investigation aimed at intensified multi-agent chemotherapy, we should look for other avenues of study. In an era of ever-increasing numbers of partially effective cancer therapeutics, there is an obvious need for more accurate methodologies. We cannot afford any more \\'trial-and-error\\' treatments.<A href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/departments/newsroom/display.cfm?id=f90987e4-8ebb-4e10-8ed282ec15dd38e9&amp;method=displayfull&amp;pn=00c8a30f-c468-11d4-80fb00508b603a14\" rel=nofollow>http://www.mdanderson.org/departments/newsroom/display.cfm?id=f90987e4-8ebb-4e10-8ed282ec15dd38e9&amp;method=displayfull&amp;pn=00c8a30f-c468-11d4-80fb00508b603a14</A>10.

As reported in MD Anderson\\'s OncoLog, in the past the only treatment for multiple metastases was whole brain radiation, which on its own had little effect on survival. There are now a variety of effective treatment modalities for people who have fewer than four tumors. Focal treatment allows retreatment of local and new recurrences (whole brain radiation is once and done, cannot be used again).<A href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/depts/oncolog/articles/05/1-jan/1-05-1.html\" rel=nofollow>http://www2.mdanderson.org/depts/oncolog/articles/05/1-jan/1-05-1.html</A>The results of a study at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported that treating four or more brain tumors in a single radiosurgery session resulted in improved survival compared to whole brain radiation therapy alone. The results indicate that treating four or more brain tumors with radiosurgery is safe and effective and translates into a survival benefit for patients. The critical idea is to focally treat all tumors. <A href=\"http://newsbureau.upmc.com/UPCI/GammaKnifeStudy2005.htm\" rel=nofollow>http://newsbureau.upmc.com/UPCI/GammaKnifeStudy2005.htm</A>',\n",

My grandfather was 84 years old and he said about 70 percent of men his age will develop prostate cancer. He also said that with such a high PSA score he was almost sure it was prostate cancer. On a positive note, he did say that prostate cancer usually is a slow growing disease and in my grandfather\\'s case he might be able to just take hormonal therapy to control the disease.

We enter the doctors office and he gets called back quickly. I was in the waiting room eating my bagel and reading a magazine when this other couple came in sat across from me.

Once detected, what happens next? When I was diagnosed, I proceded to do what I could to save my life as a result of cancer. So I had a mastectomy and gave no thought to the expense figuring that I would apply for Medicaid afterwords and it would be retroactive. I really took it for granted that as a result of near poverty income and lack of insurance that I would get Medicaid without a hitch! I was so wrong. I was denied after the first application. At that point, I was profoundly depressed as I had no resources at all to cover my surgery expenses nor could I cover any subsequent treatment. If I bought food so I could eat to stay alive, I couldn\\'t pay for anything else. So I appealed that denial and was denied again. I was ready to drive up to DC without my shirt on and make my plight very public.Eventually, I discovered things like patient assistance programs that covered my prescription medications but I\\'m still in the hole for the surgery I had almost two years ago and I\\'m afraid of the future. Cost of detection is nothing compared to the cost of treatment. It\\'s a couple hundred dollars for a mammogram or about the same for a doctor visit, depending. I go to a clinic that charges a sliding scale fee so it costs me only $40 per visit. I can\\'t imagine what it would have been like were I to decide to get chemo in addition to everything. There is no way I could afford that. Neither detection or treatment should be a choice. It should be available to all uninsured. How else can we stop this epidemic?',\n",

       " 'Gastric cancer staging by lymph node sampling has a profound effect on patient survival. Survival of patients with gastric cancer can be compromised if the staging is done inadequately. This can happen if too few lymph nodes are removed and analyzed. A study in an issue of Cancer, a peer-review journal of the American Cancer Society revealed that less than one third of gastric cancer patients had adequate lymph node assessments (ALNA). There was a change in the guidelines of the staging system for gastric cancer in 1997 but since then only minimal improvements have been made.Compliance with the new guidelines remains poor because the lymph nodes removed and sampled since the change in the guidelines only increased from 9 nodes to 10. The guidelines now say that 15 lymph nodes removed and analyzed should be the standard. The lymph nodes that are tested will show how far the cancer has spread. If you do not have the correct information that the lymph node sampling can provide it can cause the patient to receive incorrect treatments and less survival rates.

       " 'My gynecologist would ask me every time I showed up for my appointments if I was routinely doing my self breast exams.My husband found a lump in my breast. I immediately made an appointment to see my doctor. He feels the lump and then tells me that I am too young for breast cancer and to put it out of my head and not worry about the lump. At the time I thought that he could palpate the lump and know what it was. I know better now. The only way to know for sure if a lump is benign or cancerous is to biopsy it. I wish I knew then what I know now.He never even suggested a mammogram or ultrasound. He didn\\'t tell me to keep an eye on it - nothing!Eight months later I asked him about the lump again. He said \"It got bigger\". My heart sank. He did at that time send me for an ultrasound which led to a mammogram and my diagnoses. It upsets me that my cancer had already spread to one lymph node. Maybe it would have been stage one breast cancer if he would have sent me for tests when I asked about it the first time.  I took my gynecologist to court. I felt that he really dropped the ball. Why tell me to do breast exams if the lump is going to be ignored when I point it out? I lost the case based on the gynecology guidelines. The guidelines stated that a \\'persistent\\' lump should be investigated. So he was off the hook and wasn\\'t obligated to send me for a mammogram or ultrasound the first time I asked him about the lump.What really gets me is the fact that this seems to happen a lot. I have met many young women that had delayed diagnoses because the doctor considered them too young for breast cancer. A lump is a lump and it should be investigated to find out exactly what it is.

I have met many young women that had delayed diagnoses because the doctor considered them too young for breast cancer. A lump is a lump and it should be investigated to find out exactly what it is.1. The way I feel is that any lump should be considered cancerousunless proven otherwise.I read that a long time agotoo bad that moron dr. did not read the same.2. What you don\\'t realize is that if EVERY single lump were biopsied or imaged, health insurance (who picks up the tab) would be prohibitively expensive. If we had unlimited resources, we could people into PET scanners every week and never miss a cancer of any sort again -- ever. But our entire economy would be devoted to paying for it. The price we pay for trying to make healthcare \"efficient\", is that we are going to miss some low-percentage eventualities, of which your situation was an unfortunate example. Yes, it sucks, but what exactly is the alternative?3. First of all PET scans do not necessarily pick up cancer. There is no tool that we currently have that can tell you if you have cancer definitely or not. It can be small or not seen on a PET. So I think that everyone getting PET scans all the time would be ridiculous.However, I felt a breast lump. I do think it should have been investigated further. I do think every breast lump should get a mammogram. The mammogram I had, even though I am young showed a spiculated lesion that was 90 percent chance it was cancer. Mammograms are not that expensive. I\\'m not saying that every young woman needs a mammogram but If you feel an abnormality or have a family history then YES!I should have gotten that mammogram then and not eight months later. I pay my health insurance and I expect to get the tests that are needed.I refuse to be as you call it a \\'low percentage eventuality\\'!4. let me tell you why health care is so highDo you think the drug dealers who get shot every night have kept up their health insurance.Give me a break they get FREE medical Oh waitI forgot I pay for that, you pay for that.What about the girls I see in this area they have like 5, 6, 7 kids. No job no insurance.Who pays for that. The dr should have taken abiopsy immediately. I had one child and I wantthat child to be around long after I am gone.Patti Anastasi5. Even if a woman is too young to be able to get a good mammogram, there are other means by which it can be determined whether a woman has cancer or not. Even with the idea that \"if a lump is persistent\", the patient could have made another visit in a month or two instead of waiting so long. Plus, at the rate that breast cancer is increasing, yeah....you\\'re going to have more of a need to have biopsies and other types of testing done. It only makes sense. 6. The reason I did wait so long to ask my doctor again is because he pretty much was telling me 100 percent that it was definitely NOT cancer. I did try and put it out of my mind. I wish i did ask about it again sooner than 8 months but i was trusting him and believing that I was too young for breast cancer. (like he said)Patients don\\'t know that we have to ask about it more than once. How would I know that? I asked him about it and he reassured me that I was fine. It was only my hypochondric nature that made me ask about it after 8 months. 7. Usually, my doctor wants me to return every 6 months for a breast check, since I have small lumps that, so far, have been noncancerous. I agree that your doctor dropped the ball. He should have asked for a return sooner just to check that lump, especially since you had specifically asked about it. That\\'s just part of being a good provider. Wish I\\'d been part of that jury... Not that I would have awarded a great amount, but it\\'s time to quit just tapping some hands and put some responsibility on the providers to be accountable for the people they are seeing. We aren\\'t just insurance policies or numbers, we have families that depend on us - and lives to live.8. I found a lump and was sent for ultrasounds every other month for almost nine months. Each radiologist told me it was nothing, a bruise, a gland.... I was 31 with no family history, so cancer was not even a consideration. Then one radiologist saw my films and recognized it as cancer. (He wasn\\'t even my doctor, but he turned out to be my guardian angel!) I recently underwent a double mastectomy for stage 2 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. The lesson? You must be your own advocate for your health care. PUSH, NAG, do what it takes. It\\'s YOUR life!! 9. A good friend had breast cancer at 25 and died at 27 even though her doctor got on it right away. How can any doctor say someone\\'s too young? I would think the medical schools would be ashamed that there are graduates who think that \\'rare\\' means \\'never.\\'10. This story is exactly like mine. My doctor said the same thing and about eleven months later I had stage four breast cancer that spread through my lymph nodes to my bones in my back. Doctor\\'s are too worried about insurance than their patients! 11. Everything in this Country costs money, to much of it I might add. That is still no excuse for a Doctor not to do his job. I have a rare disease and if you ask me 75% of our Doctors are just plain lazy, they take to many shortcuts, to busy, or just plain Know It All\\'s. 12. I hope you have a new GYN. by now.Your story is one many young women need to here. So \"go tell it on the mountain, here, there &amp; everywhere.\" I would like to have been on your jury, also. I feel a baseline mammogram at age 30 should be an entitlement for every woman. I am a 1 yr. B.Cancer survivor age 58 &amp; no family history of breast cancer. I had an annual Diagnostic Mammo that was clear &amp; told, \"see you next yr.\" 8 wks. later I found myself with an inverted nipple, a small lunp, &amp; sitting in a Breast Surgons office. I had 2 Breast Surgons, many repeated mammo\\'s, 2 ultrasounds, 1 biopsy\\'s of the very small lump which showed Invassive Lobular cancer. Both Surgons thought the inverted nipple was scar tissue from a breast reduction I had 20 yrs ago, but previously that area did not have scar tissue. Finally 6 more wks. later a Breast MRI was ordered which showed probable cancer. Then a surgical boipsy for the nipple area (which is the area I sought out to have checked in the first place) The result of 2nd biopsy was also Invassive Lobular cancer. After 9 weeks I had a bilateral mastectomy &amp; the upsetting news 26 positive nodes with the beginning of their own small tumor. How I felt...SHOCKED! The Surgon...shocked! What I am trying to point out is the same message as Kristina even though our cancers &amp; ages are different (both NO HISTORY) it is still CANCER &amp; TIME is of the essence! This disease is or can become AGRESSIVE. We do our part in finding the abnormalities &amp; making the apt. to have areas checked. My daughter( A NURSE)&amp; I feel (that I needed an MRI &amp; surgery sooner. TIME &amp; ACTION are the key &amp; maybe if Kristina &amp; I had received ACTION instead of words we would have had 0 positive nodes. MY DAUGHTER IS 32. She found a lump in her breast recently. Her Dr. (knowing my breast history) saw her the next day. She had a mamo. &amp; ultrasound the following day. It is not cancer. I am very thankfull for her Doctor. Ladies WE have to be OUR OWN ADVOCATE. If you find an area INSIST on TESTS NOW. If your Dr will not do the tests find one who will. INSIST ON A a BREAST MRI. THERE ARE NO NORMS FOR BREAST CANCER. CANCER DOES NOT HAVE AGE LIMITS.LIVESTRONG.13. I was lucky to have an OBGYN who cares. She felt the lump during an exam-she made me a follow-up appt 10 days later-lump still there-she made me appointments for a mammogram and ultrasound. Mammogram didn\\'t show anything but the ultrasound did. It was her care, knowledge and persistance that lead to my diaognois. I had two lumps with three different types of cancer in one breast. It had also spread to my lymp nodes. Stage IIA. I had to have a mastectomy and 6 months of chemo. December of 06 will be two years since last treatment. There was no breast cancer in my family and I was 37 when diagnosed. I hope your prognosis turns out as well as mine has thus far.',\n",
       " 'A few days ago I posted about Cathy\\'s EC Cafe. It\\'s a webpage designed to help those diagnosed with esophageal cancer. In that post I mentioned one of the stories I liked on the webpage written by a six year esophageal cancer survivor named Barry Bokhaut. I decided to email Barry and talk to him about his experience and any advice he might have for those diagnosed.I think Barry\\'s story is inspirational and can help others newly diagnosed know that survival is possible even though the statistics look grim. According to the American Cancer Society 13,770 of the 14,550 estimated cases of esophageal cancer in 2006 will die of their disease. At the current time only less than 20 percent of patients survive five years.Barry answered the question as to why esphageal cancer is so hard to cure. \"Esophageal cancer\\'s low survival rates is in a large part due to the fact that the symptoms are very benign, and the disease is often very advanced before doctors properly diagnose it. Far too many people are told by their doctors that they are suffering from heart burn or indigestion, and are given antacids. By the time the difficultly in swallowing manifests, and the doctors get around to a full diagnostic workup, the disease is very established and extremely difficult to deal with, as it spreads quickly.\"Some symptoms of esophageal cancer are:     Heartburn    Difficulty swallowing    Inability to swallow solid foods (eventually liquids also)    Pain with swallowing    Food sticking in esophagus    Weight loss    Regurgitation of undigested food    Vomiting blood or passing old blood with bowel movementsAs you can see with these symptoms that the disease can be very hard to diagnose since heartburn is a common ailment and that once the other symptoms start its already at the advanced stages.Barry\\'s advice to newly diagnosed patients is \"The need to have a positive attitude, knowing that published statistics state you have a very little chance of survival. (The statistics provided by the Canadian Cancer Society show that esophageal cancer patients have less than a zero chance of surviving more than five years). Statistics lie, and there are survivors - I\\'m in my sixth year\"Barry says that \"If you are going to survive, you have to drop what you are doing, and focus on getting the treatment without delay. This involves being very assertive and demanding front of the line treatment. If you sit back and wait, you aren\\'t going to make it. The need to go at your cancer all out, to pull out all the stops and take the most aggressive treatment that doctors will allow. Anything short of that will likely not result in a positive resolution (the nice way of saying death)\"Barry has also survived a heart attack and has been left with bone damage from his treatments for cancer. He is very active with the Canadian Cancer Society\\'s Peer Support group. He provides counseling to newly diagnosed patients, as well as those that have been dealing with the disease for awhile. Barry is called to counsel patients all across Canada. He has helped these people cope and make the right decisions on their treatment. Barry says that it is such a rewarding experience for him and helps him see his experience in a positive light.Most of all, though, Barry would like to highlight how wonderful life is, and how great it is to still be around.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention, Kristina.It is at least plausible that taking 5 mg of finasteride daily would also help, as it resulted in a 25% reduction in prostate cancer in the huge (about 18,000 men) and long (about seven years) Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial. Recent analysis also proved that finasteride is safe, a news item that the media has missed in a major, disgraceful media blunder -- no Pulitzer Prizes for that coverage. I\\'ve written an article about it from my survivor\\'s viewpoint, drawing on information in the paper and accompanying analysis in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, that is posted at <A href=\"http://www.mycancerplace.com/forum/?action=view_topic&amp;id=43&amp;fid=18\" rel=nofollow>http://www.mycancerplace.com/forum/?action=view_topic&amp;id=43&amp;fid=18</A>. One of the leading experts in prostate cancer whom I follow confirmed to me that it is great news.The questions are whether finasteride would work as well (or perhaps even better) in men diagnosed with PIN, and how it would work in conjunction with Toremifene. Finasteride just became generic in the past few months; all my previous prescriptions have been for its predecessor, Proscar. A closely related but much newer drug, Avodart, appears to be even more promising, with reductions in prostate cancer incidence at around the 50% mark per preliminary research with relatively few patients.Jim (Web Page at <A href=\"http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147\" rel=nofollow>http://www.mycancerplace.com/profile.php?id=147</A>)',\n",

Can you tell me which issue of the Annals of Surgical Oncology listed these results. Also, the title of the article would be greatly appreciated. I was recently diagnosed with colon cancer and metastasis to the liver. I have undergone surgery to remove the tumor from my colon and am currently undergoing chemo in order to make my liver operable. Thanks, 2. As a colon cancer patient with liver metastases, I have undergone this surgery. After every CT scan, I asked my oncologist if I would qualify. After 6 months of chemo, he referred me to a surgeon. I now show no evidence of disease which is something they told me was highly unlikely at my time of diagnosis. Anyone with liver metastases should be looking into this or radio frequency ablation as possibilities to extend survival time.3. I have four tumors on the liver and one in the colon, I have undergone 7 chemos to shrink the tumors to opera-bility. They hope that after #8 I will be at that stage. It was previously thought very unlikely, since one tumor was 23 cm by 6 cm. I feel extremely hopeful but nervous about surgery. Thank you for your insights both in the article and the comments. I know that surgery is required to save my life. I am only 36 years old and was diagnosed one week after our first child\\'s birth in July. Others\\' stories are very inspirational.4. My husband was just diagnosed with liver cancer, primary, not metastasized from the colon. The survival rates we have been quoted are lower than what has been posted here.

S. Howell, thanks for the commentYou are very correct. IBC is different and I wouldn\\'t want anyone to read my post and think its ok to wait to have chemotherapy if you are diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer.I wish more women knew about IBC, the signs and symptoms. I think way too many are delayed diagnoses because it resembles an infection.Kristi Collins2. It may be safe for the common cancer, but mine was inflammatory breast cancer, a hot and nasty, which metastatized during the 4 week period between my 4th chemo and surgery. Waiting the additional 4 weeks to heal up was critical time that sent me to Stage 4 and assured my terminal status.',\n",
       " 'Earlier this month I blogged about a book called Dear Cancer. The author, Laura Parisi King is a breast cancer survivor. I met Laura through the Young Survival Coalition and she agreed to do an interview with me about her breast cancer journey.When were you diagnosed with breast cancer?I was diagnosed with cancer on October 9, 2002. I was 41 years old. I had found a large mass in my right breast and was told by a doctor in Florida that it was just fibrocystic tissue and that it was nothing to worry about. After seven months of \\'not worrying\\', my GYN in New York felt the mass and sent me to a surgeon. The surgeon said that the mass had to come out. He removed it and told me that it was cancer. After many tests I learned that the cancer had already spread. I have it in both lungs, both hips, my ribcage, sternum, spine and neck. What types of breast cancer treatments were recommended?The doctor first recommended hormone therapy with Tamoxifen. I stayed on it for a number of months however, my cancer markers kept climbing so I was put on the chemotherapy Taxotere. I stayed on that for over a year and then after my cancer markers were back to normal I went back on the hormonal drugs, Femora and Faslodex. I\\'m now back on chemo because the hormones don\\'t seem to be working anymore. I\\'m now on Navalbine. I also get Zometa to strengthen by bones and Lupron to keep me in menopause.How did you research breast cancer and breast cancer treatments?I used the internet...A LOT. I also talked with other women who had been through treatment for breast cancer. I read a lot too.Are you involved in any breast cancer support groups , fundraisers or breast cancer organizations?I have a group that I go to that is specifically for Stage IV patients. I\\'m also involved with a wellness center in my area. They offer yoga, Tai Chi, and other programs. I\\'ll be doing a writing workshop for them in the near future. I\\'m involved with other groups via the internet, posting on their bulletin boards.What advice would you give to someone newly diagnosed with breast cancer?DON\\'T PANIC! The beginning is the hardest part. You\\'ve usually just been through surgery and are trying to recuperate from that so your not at your strongest. Also at the beginning you feel bombarded with confusing information and you feel that you want to start treatment yesterday to get this behind you. BE HONEST! If your tired, tell people that your tired. If you need help, tell people that you need help. And mostly be honest with your emotions. Let yourself cry, scream, even laugh...and know that any emotion is OK and normal. Your not the first and you won\\'t be the last to feel as you do.What advice would you give the family members and friends of someone diagnosed with breast cancer?Be sensitive to the fact that they are overwhelmed by the new physical and emotional burdens. Let them talk if they need to but don\\'t push them to talk. Don\\'t treat them like they are the walking dead. Its OK to laugh even though cancer is in their life. Be specific about how you can help them. Tell them that you\\'ll pick their kids up to come to your house for the afternoon so they can rest..offer to do their laundry..drop off a video for them or a good book...cook them a meal that they can stick in the freezer for a day when they aren\\'t feeling well. Remember that everyone is different and everyone will react to their diagnosis differently. If one friend has cancer and doesn\\'t mind being teased about her bald head, that doesn\\'t mean that another friend will react the same way. Call and check up on them, let them know they don\\'t have to go through this alone.As a breast cancer survivor, what thoughts do you have on surviving breast cancer and being a breast cancer survivor?I wrote in my book that \"I have a hard time seeing myself as a cancer survivor while I\\'m still entrenched in the heat of the battle\". Being that I have Stage IV cancer, I will probably be on one treatment or another for the rest of my life. I do feel a sense of pride for how I have handled the disease so far. My husband also has cancer. He was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. I think the two of us have done a great job of staying positive, keeping a sense of humor and doing our part to encourage and support others who are dealing with this.Name three breast cancer books you would recommend:Dear Cancer of course would be the first on my must read list. (I couldn\\'t resist saying that because I wrote it). I really am proud of the book though because it touches every emotion. So many women and men feel that its wrong to feel jealous of other people\\'s good health, or its wrong to have a feeling of dread when they have to give their family bad news. This book lets them know that its ok. Its not wrong. It\\'s ok and normal to laugh, cry or scream. It validates everything that they are feeling. Dr. Susan Love\\'s breast book was very informative. I got a lot of my information from that book when I was first diagnosed. The American Cancer Society used to put out a book called A Breast Cancer Journey or A Journey Through Breast Cancer. I forget the actual title but it was also very informative. If someone were to call the American Cancer Society I\\'m sure they would be able to tell them the exact title and how to get it.Name other breast cancer related resources, on or offline, that you would recommend?Living Beyond Breast Cancer (LBBC). I found them on the internet. Its a great site to go to for information and to get support from the on-line bulletin board. My local breast cancer coalition has been an invaluable support. They have helped me arrange cleaning services when I wasn\\'t feeling well. They have helped me with financial issues. They have informed me about different resources that are that available in my community to anyone with breast cancer. The Young Survival Coalition (YSC) is for women under forty who have been diagnosed. Its a great site to go to for information and support.What is your background?I\\'m a New York State Licensed Master Social Worker. I\\'m a writer and have had numerous fiction and non-fiction articles published in various magazines. I wrote, and had published, a young adult novel called Granda. I\\'m also a sailor. My husband and I were full time live-aboard cruisers for five years and 21,000 miles.Why did you write Dear Cancer and where can people get a copy?I didn\\'t intent to write a book when I was first diagnosed. I wrote a quick note that said, Dear Cancer, You cannot defeat me. I turned that note into a longer writing telling cancer WHY it couldn\\'t defeat me. It felt good to take a position of strength against this illness so I wrote another poem and another and another. I started to share the writing with women in my support group and at the oncology office and they encouraged me to put them together into a book and make it available to people who are going through cancer or any life challenge. Since its been out, I have received many emails, letters and phone calls from people thanking me for putting into words what they have been feeling but were unable to express. I feel proud to have done something positive with such a frightening experience.

I\\'m glad to see that they are finding more options in the fight against cancers. I believe that if our efforts are combined together, we will find a cure for all cancers. My daughter, who is in her senior year of high school, has made a decision to contribute her life to this fight and to go to college for pre-med with aspirations of becoming a pediatric oncologist. The wall of her bedroom is covered with articles and newspaper clpplings relative to cancer topics. She says that this helps her focus on why she needs to take school seriously and always do her best. We should all have such focus in our lives with the sole purpose of helping others.',\n",

       " 'If you have been diagnosed with cancer it is important to understand what a clinical trial is and also where you can find out information on how to get into one. Clinical trials must be done before a new treatment is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). There are different types or phases of clinical trials. Each phase is designed to find out different information. Each new phase of a clinical trial depends on and builds on information from an earlier phase.     Phase I clinical trials are to find out the   best way to give a new treatment and how much of it can be given safely.   Researchers will closely monitor the patient\\'s side effects and adjust the   dosage as needed. This phase is usually only tested on a small amount of   participants. Phase I trials can have significant risks associated with them   for the patient because the drug or new treatment regimen has been studied in   the lab but not on humans. The research in the lab cannot identify all the   side effects that might occur. Phase I trials are usually only offered to   those who\\'s cancer cannot be helped by other known treatments available.    Phase II clinical trials attempt to determine a   patient\\'s response to treatments. Patients are closely monitored to see if the   new treatment controls the cancer or shrinks it. Side effects are also   assessed at this phase because the trial involves more people so they can see   a larger group and how they react to the new treatment.    Phase III clinical trials look for longer life,   better quality of life, fewer side effects and fewer cases of the cancer   returning. These trials enroll a large number of patients (sometimes   thousands). The patients are usually divided into two groups. One group will   receive the standard therapy available for their type of cancer and the other   group will get the new treatment. Patients are usually assigned by chance for   the two separate groups being studied. Cancer patients do not have to just count on trial information from their physicians. The patient can directly investigate their own eligibility for a clinical trial by calling the Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER.

       " 'Before I had my first chemotherapy treatment I was told that to prevent from getting nauseous and vomiting as a side effect that I could take a pill. I mean, what is worse than being nauseous all the time? Not too many things. I was prepared after my first chemotherapy of Adriamycin and Cytoxan to be leaning over the toilet for a long time. This vision was what I expected to happen and I tried to be ready for it knowing that the anti-nausea drugs given aren\\'t always effective for everyone. I did end up spending a lot of time near the toilet after taking Zophran, an anti-nausea medication, but I spent that time on the toilet, not leaning over it!  The drug Zophran belongs to a general class of drugs called serotonin antagonists. It is one of many anti-nausea medications given to help prevent one of the main side effects from chemotherapy treatments. The drug worked for me. It worked so well that I hardly felt nauseous at all and did not vomit during my treatments. However, I did not listen when the oncology nurse said to take Senokot, a laxative, for the side effect from the medication that helps another side effect. That is what usually happens with cancer treatments. You can take one drug to prevent one thing and then another drug on top of that one to combat that drugs side effects. Zophran can cause constipation and I guess I just thought I could take the Senokot if I did become constipated. That wasn\\'t such a good idea and I learned the next time to take the laxative with the anti-nausea medication.I did think it was neat that a drug could stop me from getting nausea and vomiting. How does this work? Well, It has nothing to do with your stomach. It all has to do with your brain. The drug that I took, Zophran, is a serotonin antagonist that works by blocking the serotonin pathway to the vomiting center of the brain so the brain no longer receives the vomiting message.Zophran is the drug my oncologist gave to me. Your oncologist might offer a different anti-nausea medication. My tips for today would be:   Make sure you tell your doctor if the anti-nausea medication he prescribed   is not working for you. Switching to a different drug might do the trick.   If one of the side effects from your anti-nausea medication is   constipation... take that laxative now, not later!

       " 'Malignant glioma is the most common primary brain tumor. The outlook for patients with malignant glioma is poor. Median survival for patients with grade III glioma is three to five years and less than one year for the most aggressive form of malignant glioma called glioblastoma multiforme.The virus or reovirus that the researchers are focusing on is a common virus in humans that inhabits the lungs and intestines.

       " 'I loved Ann\\'s story, you will too. Ann is a fellow young breast cancer survivor. She lost her mother at a young age to breast cancer. Ann has two sons and when she was diagnosed she knew that she had to handle the situation differently when it came to telling her children what was going on. When she was young and her mother was diagnosed the family tried to protect her by not giving her information about what was going on with her mom. She knows first hand how that approach, though well meaning, only made her more scared and confused. Ann has a lot of good advice to share and feels honored to share her story with us. You can also read more about Ann in her blog called The Life Journal of Geeky Gal. How did you find out you had breast cancer?In April 2003, maybe a week before my regular yearly exam with my GYN, I was lying in bed watching TV with my hubby when he turned over and accidentally sort of pinched my breast under his arm a little. Right then, I had the impression of having a lump in my breast. I was startled and sat upright, in a stunned silence, feeling the area over and over. He asked me what was wrong, and I told him that it felt strange, kind of like I had felt a lump in there, but I couldn\\'t find it after the fact. I don\\'t know if my tissue swelled up because of the pinch or what. Anyway, I kept trying to feel it again all night, but to no avail, so I filed it away, figuring the doctor would let me know in a week if there was any problem. By the time I went in for my exam the following week, I had all but forgotten the incident when my doctor came in chatting and started right in by examining my left breast. Almost immediately came the uh-oh moment--\"Ann, did you know there was a lump here?\" I swallowed sheepishly, \"um, no\". I was only 36 years old, but he was concerned because of my family history. (my mother had breast cancer and died at a relatively young age). He said the lump felt rubbery and movable, and that was a good sign. Most likely a cyst, but we had to be sure. A few whirlwind hours later I had completed a diagnostic mammogram, and sat at home mulling all this over when my doctor called and said \"I\\'m so sorry, I was wrong. Your mammogram indicates a very high probability of malignancy. You need a biopsy\". So that day, May 1, 2003 is the day I mark as the anniversary of my cancer survivorship..my cancerversary. That\\'s when I went into fighting mode. What types of breast cancer treatments were recommended?Because of the relative size and location of the lump, I was not a candidate for lumpectomy, so we were planning mastectomy right from the start. However, because of my age and my family history it was recommended that I have genetic testing done to see if I was a BRCA mutation carrier. I went ahead with the mastectomy while waiting for the results, which ended up coming back positive for the BRCA1 mutation. I had a sentinel node biopsy with no node involvement and a modified radical mastectomy with clean surgical margins, staged at IIA. Radiation was not recommended in my case, but it was agreed that I would begin chemotherapy. I began a dose dense regimen of Adriamycin, Cytoxan and Taxol. In the end, the combined factors of my age, the pathology of my cancer, and my family history, along with my own personal feelings and history with the disease led me to later opt for a contra-lateral mastectomy and bilateral reconstruction. I also had a prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Look that one up on the internet!How did you research breast cancer and breast cancer treatments?I used resources on the internet a lot and I bought a ton of books. I also sought out and gained help of other young survivors through an online support group aimed specifically at women like me. My hubby attended nearly every appointment and procedure with me, and took copious notes, which we poured over later, formulating new questions to ask or topics to research. We used to joke that our newest hobby was oncology. How did you tell your family?Wow, it\\'s tough to think about that again. After my doctor visit revealed this lump and my mammogram was scheduled, I called my hubby and let him know what was going on. After my mammogram and ultrasound, I had a terrible feeling. It was something in a way the ultrasound tech would not make eye contact with me. I was expecting bad news. When I returned home that afternoon to wait, I was determined not to worry anyone else until I knew something for sure. But when the doctor called with the preliminary mammography results (BI-RADS 5, highly suggestive of malignancy). I immediately looked up on the internet and found that meant there was something of a 90% chance I had cancer. I was referred for a biopsy. I called my husband and said \"Drive carefully, but get here as fast as you can, because I\\'m pretty sure I have cancer\". When he walked through the door, I just held him and cried the longest time. The next person I told was my sister, but honestly I don\\'t remember exactly when. It was definitely a whirlwind of a few days. One of the things I worried about was telling my kids. I have two sons, who at the time were ten and four. I thought a lot about how to tell them, and to me there was no choice but to be completely upfront about it, although we decided to wait a couple of weeks until they were done with the school year. We just didn\\'t want to stress them out, and honestly in the meantime I had a lot of research and appointments and tests to complete before we got down to decisions anyway. When the right time came, we broke the news to them together, and then sat each of them down individually and told them everything we could but at a level we thought they could understand. We wanted to give them the facts but not overload them. We wanted to leave the door open so they could ask questions at any time. I felt strongly about all of this, having been a young child myself when my mother was diagnosed, and having it handled in almost a completely opposite manner. In hindsight, I think my family wanted to protect me from what was happening to my mom, but they didn\\'t realize that not talking about things made everything I saw even more scary. So, we were very open with the boys, and they both handled it very well, in very different ways. One of the hardest parts for me was sharing my genetic results with my siblings. I know this is something that many people who find that they are positive for one of the BRCA mutations struggle with. You feel a bit guilty and a little bit like the voice of doom, particularly if you are the first one in the family to find this. In my case, I was lucky that my siblings all accepted the information graciously, if not happily. Are you involved in any breast cancer support groups, fundraisers or breast cancer organizations?I participate in an online community for young survivors. I think its important for each person that goes through this to find the source or sources of support that resonate with them, and with me, it was the group--Sisters In Survivorship. I also have been involved with the group at FORCE (Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered) at http://www.facingourrisk.org/ because of the hereditary aspect of my disease. We support LAF (Lance Armstrong Foundation) because this is a great organization and really resonates with my boys. Finally, I am a big supporter of the Breast Cancer 3-Day, supporting the Susan G Komen Foundation and National Philanthropic Trust Breast Cancer Fund. I participated in two of these events so far, and I know there are more in my future.What advice would you give to someone newly diagnosed with breast cancer?First, get all the opinions from all the doctors you need to make an informed decision and be comfortable with your treatment plan. It is important to be comfortable with the doctors treating you, but it can be a very good thing to get other perspectives and professional opinions. I know during my journey, I encountered doctors that I would not necessarily want to work with long term, but they all provided very valuable insights and perspectives on things. Second, you will probably feel in a hurry to get treatment underway, and when someone tells you that you have plenty of time to wait for that next appointment, you might feel like screaming at them. And by all means, push away for earlier appointments and call to see if they have cancellations. But remember you really do have time to do your homework and make very informed choices, so try to use your waiting time to do research, write down questions etc. If someone offers to have a survivor friend call you or gives you their email address, take the opportunity to make contact, get some questions answered. The more confident you feel in the decisions you make, the easier it will be to get through it.What advice would you give to the family members and friends of someone diagnosed with breast cancer?Don\\'t start treating your friend or family member differently when you find out they have cancer. They are still the same person, they just face a new challenge. They need you to let them know you care, just by doing the things your normally do. Kiss them, take them to the movies, make them laugh, tell them when they are being a bonehead..whatever you normally do. They didn\\'t just turn into glass and they don\\'t need to be handled with kid gloves. As a breast cancer survivor, what thoughts do you have on surviving breast cancer and being a breast cancer survivor?Well, I have a lot of thoughts and feeling that still well up, years after the fact, and sometimes at the drop of a hat. I suppose that\\'s why they call us survivors. But mostly, I just would say that I do feel responsible and honored to share my story, because when I was diagnosed I never realized just how many survivors were all around me. I think when your faced with it, its a wonderful gift to learn that someone you didn\\'t realize was a survivor. It definitely gives a message of hope. I don\\'t want anyone facing breast cancer (or any other cancer for that matter) to feel ALONE.Name three breast cancer related books you would recommend:My personal favorite was It\\'s Not About the Bike by Lance Armstrong, though obviously its not breast cancer specific.I also recommend The Breast Cancer Survival Manual. I have passed mine around a few times already. If you are just starting with your battle and want fairly straightforward, informative, but not overwhelming book to get you started.The Breast Cancer Reconstruction Guidebook, definitely a book that helped me with my decision making.Name other breast cancer related resources, on or offline that you recommend:Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered, http://www.facingourrisk.org/, is a great one if hereditary cancer is a concern for you.The National Cancer Society website, which is very comprehensive and holds a ton of information on all aspects of breast cancer.And when I was diagnosed, I found that I had a new best friend named GOOGLE. She was a great help in searching for terms and building my cancer vocabulary!

I called my husband and said \"Drive carefully, but get here as fast as you can, because I\\'m pretty sure I have cancer\". When he walked through the door, I just held him and cried the longest time. The next person I told was my sister, but honestly I don\\'t remember exactly when. It was definitely a whirlwind of a few days. One of the things I worried about was telling my kids. I have two sons, who at the time were ten and four. I thought a lot about how to tell them, and to me there was no choice but to be completely upfront about it, although we decided to wait a couple of weeks until they were done with the school year. We just didn\\'t want to stress them out, and honestly in the meantime I had a lot of research and appointments and tests to complete before we got down to decisions anyway. When the right time came, we broke the news to them together, and then sat each of them down individually and told them everything we could but at a level we thought they could understand. We wanted to give them the facts but not overload them. We wanted to leave the door open so they could ask questions at any time. I felt strongly about all of this, having been a young child myself when my mother was diagnosed, and having it handled in almost a completely opposite manner. In hindsight, I think my family wanted to protect me from what was happening to my mom, but they didn\\'t realize that not talking about things made everything I saw even more scary. So, we were very open with the boys, and they both handled it very well, in very different ways. One of the hardest parts for me was sharing my genetic results with my siblings. I know this is something that many people who find that they are positive for one of the BRCA mutations struggle with. You feel a bit guilty and a little bit like the voice of doom, particularly if you are the first one in the family to find this. In my case, I was lucky that my siblings all accepted the information graciously, if not happily. <STRONG>Are you involved in any breast cancer support groups, fundraisers or breast cancer organizations?I participate in an online community for young survivors. I think its important for each person that goes through this to find the source or sources of support that resonate with them, and with me, it was the group--Sisters In Survivorship. I also have been involved with the group at FORCE (Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered) at <A href=\"http://www.facingourrisk.org/\">http://www.facingourrisk.org/</A> because of the hereditary aspect of my disease. We support LAF (Lance Armstrong Foundation) because this is a great organization and really resonates with my boys. Finally, I am a big supporter of the Breast Cancer 3-Day, supporting the Susan G Komen Foundation and National Philanthropic Trust Breast Cancer Fund. I participated in two of these events so far, and I know there are more in my future.<STRONG>What advice would you give to someone newly diagnosed with breast cancer?First, get all the opinions from all the doctors you need to make an informed decision and be comfortable with your treatment plan. It is important to be comfortable with the doctors treating you, but it can be a very good thing to get other perspectives and professional opinions. I know during my journey, I encountered doctors that I would not necessarily want to work with long term, but they all provided very valuable insights and perspectives on things. Second, you will probably feel in a hurry to get treatment underway, and when someone tells you that you have plenty of time to wait for that next appointment, you might feel like screaming at them. And by all means, push away for earlier appointments and call to see if they have cancellations. But remember you really do have time to do your homework and make very informed choices, so try to use your waiting time to do research, write down questions etc. If someone offers to have a survivor friend call you or gives you their email address, take the opportunity to make contact, get some questions answered. The more confident you feel in the decisions you make, the easier it will be to get through it.<STRONG>What advice would you give to the family members and friends of someone diagnosed with breast cancer?Don\\'t start treating your friend or family member differently when you find out they have cancer. They are still the same person, they just face a new challenge. They need you to let them know you care, just by doing the things your normally do. Kiss them, take them to the movies, make them laugh, tell them when they are being a bonehead..whatever you normally do. They didn\\'t just turn into glass and they don\\'t need to be handled with kid gloves. <STRONG>As a breast cancer survivor, what thoughts do you have on surviving breast cancer and being a breast cancer survivor?Well, I have a lot of thoughts and feeling that still well up, years after the fact, and sometimes at the drop of a hat. I suppose that\\'s why they call us survivors. But mostly, I just would say that I do feel responsible and honored to share my story, because when I was diagnosed I never realized just how many survivors were all around me. I think when your faced with it, its a wonderful gift to learn that someone you didn\\'t realize was a survivor. It definitely gives a message of hope. I don\\'t want anyone facing breast cancer (or any other cancer for that matter) to feel ALONE.<STRONG>Name three breast cancer related books you would recommend:My personal favorite was<EM> <A href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-About-Bike-Journey/dp/B000H2MIBA/sr=8-1/qid=1160757226/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-0308780-7545748?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books\"><EM>It\\'s Not About the Bike</EM></A> by Lance Armstrong, though obviously its not breast cancer specific.I also recommend <EM><A href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Breast-Cancer-Survival-Manual-Diagnosed/dp/B000H2MSG0/sr=1-1/qid=1160757263/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-0308780-7545748?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books\">The Breast Cancer Survival Manual</A>.

She was a great help in searching for terms and building my cancer vocabulary!1. Breast Cancer Awareness Bracelet. Really pretty. I get compliments on mine all the time. Best part is they dedicate a nice donation to the Breast Cancer Awareness Foundation in the name of the brave woman that you suggest. It\\'s a great gift, but I bought some for myself in honor of a few women that I know. I wear it thinking of them and when they see that I still have it, it makes a great impression too. Besides it\\'s so pretty that many girls ask me where I got it. I\\'m proud to expain that It\\'s dedicated to someone and it represents my donation.Be Strong,Marionwww.jackiejet.com',\n",

       " 'Jennifer is a young breast cancer survivor that was also faced with the diagnoses of leukemia after her breast cancer journey. Jennifer is surviving and living life to the fullest. She knows how precious life is and she wanted to share her story with us. How did you find out you had breast cancer?I found my lump myself when I scratched an itch on the outer part of my left breast. Within the next two weeks I had a mammogram, ultrasound and needle core biopsy. On May 16, 2002, I was diagnosed with stage 2b breast cancer. It was an aggressive tumor; it was not detected on a routine mammogram four months earlier. If it was not for the urgency of the radiologist, who is a breast cancer survivor herself, my cancer could have been diagnosed at a later stage, and I might not be here today. What types of breast cancer treatments were recommended?I was recommended the same treatment by three different oncologists. All recommended chemotherapy and radiation, however, only one oncologist recommended a different chemotherapy regimen. Cyclophosphamide, Epirubicin and Fluorouracil (CEF) rather than Adriamycin, Cytoxan and Taxol (ACT).How did you research breast cancer and breast cancer treatments?I didn\\'t. I was in shock. I couldn\\'t think. I couldn\\'t see. My brain shut down. My husband did all the research for me but we both made the decision together as to which oncologist to go with and which chemotherapy regimen to take. When it came to radiation, my case could have gone either way: with or without radiation. Of course the radiation oncologists that I interviewed recommended that I have radiation. My decision was made totally by myself. My husband was totally against radiation because of the future health risk associated with it. But I felt I had to do everything in my power to get rid of any cancer I had left in my body at this time in my life. I had a 20 month old daughter at home and I wanted to be there for her as long as I could.How did you tell your family?Breast cancer runs in my family so when I had found the lump and told everyone, I think we all knew that I had cancer.

I also model mastectomy swimwear for a local mastectomy prosthetics and for the Anne Arundel Medical Center Women\\'s Retreat. I have been interviewed by our local newspaper and featured WJZ\\'s (channel 13 in Baltimore) Sunday morning health program, On Time.What advice would you give to someone newly diagnosed with breast cancer?Accept all the help you are offered no matter how much you think you don\\'t need it. Let neighbors cook dinner for you, allow family and friends to take the kids for few hours or drive them to sports practices, music lessons, ect. Let your family and friends clean your house (you should accept this offer any time in your life!). Delegate chores to all family members; even a five year old can put away laundry and empty small trash cans around the house.What advice would your give the family members and friends of someone diagnosed with breast cancer?Offer help. Whether it is housework, grocery shopping, transporting kids to soccer games, Sunday school, making meals etc. Just offer help in some helpful manner. Instead of focusing on sending flowers or stopping by to see how they are doing, actually DO something for them to make their life easier. Flowers die, cards get thrown away, phone calls can be ignored. A meal will be eaten. Rides for the kids are always appreciated. Dropping off basic groceries is a time saver. Think smart. Think about what YOU would want if you needed help.As a breast cancer survivor, what thoughts do you have on surviving breast cancer and being a breast cancer survivor?I am also a leukemia survivor (1 1/2 years), so having survived two primary cancers in the past four and a half years, I know life is precious. I almost died from cardiac arrest while being treated for leukemia, and as I was unconscious with my heart not beating and me not breathing, a voice spoke to me. It said \"Don\\'t worry. They will take care of you. Just let them take care of you\". I immediately stopped fighting, fell at ease and at peace, and I let them take care of me. I literally -Let go and Let God. I have since found my faith again, joined my church, and always listen to my inner voice.

It is given to lower testosterone levels or block the effects of testosterone, which can stimulate the growth of hormone-dependent types of prostate cancer.Hormonal therapy can have side effects and one of these can be bone loss. According to an article recently published in the Journal of Urology, Zometa (zoledronic acid) appears to reduce bone loss caused by hormone therapy among patients with prostate cancer that has not metastasized.A clinical study was conducted to further evaluate Zometa among men with prostate cancer. The study included 120 men who have been treated with hormone therapy in the past twelve months.

Kristina - Thanks for posting this and helping get the word out. While the knowledge has been available for some time, the medical community has been slow to absorb it and still needs to get the message, especially about fairly new drugs like Zometa.Having a challenging case caused me to link up with leaders in the field early, and I learned that those who were expert in hormonal blockade had identified this threat in the 90s. In fact, there\\'s an issue of PCRI Insights newsletter available free online electronically from January 1999 that describes the threat of bone density loss and what to do about it.I was very surprised that back around 2000, just after my diagnosis, most doctors I talked to were unfamiliar with the threat, with the tests needed, and how to counter it. That is changing, as medical oncologists were hearing about the threat several years ago from their professional association, and the urologists were learning about it more recently from their association. I have been taking Fosamax for years, as a DEXA scan determined that I had developed osteopenia; this was about ten months after starting hormonal blockade. For most men, especially those with arthritis or calcification of the blood vessels, a qCT scan, quantitative CT scan, is better, as that is not fooled by those conditiong, leading to a false report of healthy bones.

      "Right now -- at this very moment -- my two boys have turned our living room into a mess of blankets and pillows and stuffed animals. They put on their jammies and closed all the blinds and are pretending it's bedtime. But it's actually lunch time, so they have spread out paper plates and plastic silverware and bags of chips and boxes of crackers all over the floor -- on top of all their bedding. I delivered them their lunch platters and lemonade and there they sit, in the room next to me -- chattering away, stuffing their little mouths, full of life. And I am in awe -- of the simple joy that comes from a living room camp-out and picnic, of the beauty these children bring into my life. I am mostly in awe of the fact that no matter what cancer takes from me -- my hair, moments of health, my innocence -- it cannot ever take this very moment from me. And that makes today a happy day.

      "The Lung Cancer Alliance -- the only national non-profit organization dedicated entirely to lung cancer patient support and advocacy -- asked pulmonary clinical nurse specialist Donna Wilson to help educate the lung cancer community about healthy breathing. Wilson agreed and her breathing tips, available on podcast, are intended to relieve shortness of breath related to pain or activity. Her three breathing techniques -- detailed here -- are simple, easy-to-understand, and truly relaxing.Before beginning this series of breathing exercises, stop whatever you are doing and sit down or lean against a wall.   Place chin to your chest to relax your neck muscles. Breathe 10 short   bursts of air in and out of your lips. As you expel air, neck and chest   muscles should relax.   Place chin to your chest. Breathe three times in through your nose and out   through your mouth.   Place chin to your chest. Close your mouth, and breathe four times in and   out only through your nose.After completing these exercises, lift your head, breathe normally, and let your shoulders relax. In a few minutes, your entire body should start to relax -- and shortness of breath will resolve.I don't have lung cancer -- but I do have moments of anxiety and panic. So I plan to save these tips. And I plan to use them. And I plan to share them. Because we all can benefit from a dose of relaxation. Comments: 1. Thank you for posting? useful thing2. I never heard this before. Useful information.3. ... this exercise works, I just tried it! ... Thanks for this. :)4. A nice little example of how paying attention to one particular form of cancer can be of benefit to everybody.\n",
